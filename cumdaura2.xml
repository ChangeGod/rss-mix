                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America analysts suggest that Monday’s market rally, sparked by news of a U.S.-China tariff agreement, may reflect the so-called “Trump put” — the notion that Trump will act to limit stock market declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; “The recent news flow on trade suggests that de-escalation is likely to continue.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Trump put is alive and well.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The administration is incentivised to avoid a recession, and more trade deals are likely forthcoming.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts go on to day that despite recent deals with China and the U.K., the 10% baseline tariff introduced on April 2 is “likely here to stay.” That view was echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said Sunday that the baseline tariff is expected “to be in place for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are very forgiving. They&apos;ll punish you for stuffing things up, but if you move to fix it, all is forgiven! Tariffs are still the highest since WW2 so there is still some work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A significant reduction in U.S.-China trade barriers may ease the risk of a severe supply-driven inflation shock. However, Deutsche Bank economists caution that inflation remains persistent enough to keep the Federal Reserve from rushing into rate cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the trade war is de-escalating, &quot;policies are likely to keep inflation at uncomfortably high levels for the Fed,&quot; the analysts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;This announcement therefore reinforces our view that the Fed is going to be slow to cut rates this year.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche continues to expect the Fed’s first rate cut to come no earlier than December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/goldman-sachs-expect-a-federal-reserve-rate-cut-now-in-december-instead-of-in-july-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs expect a Federal Reserve rate cut now in December, instead of in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/icymi-citi-forecasts-a-july-federal-reserve-rate-cut-instead-of-in-june-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ICYMI - Citi forecasts a July Federal Reserve rate cut instead of in June&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Citi has lowered its 0–3 month gold price target to $3,150/oz, down from a previous forecast, citing expectations of consolidation following recent gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysts at the bank now anticipate the metal will trade in a range of $3,000 to $3,300/oz in the near term&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite today&apos;s fall, support for gold is continuing with ongoing macro uncertainty and central bank demand among the drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup economists have moved their forecast for the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate cut to July, from June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the announcement that the US will reduce its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi expects cuts at each meeting between July and January, totalling 125 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This call from Citi is very much at odds with that from Goldman Sachs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/goldman-sachs-expect-a-federal-reserve-rate-cut-now-in-december-instead-of-in-july-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs expect a Federal Reserve rate cut now in December, instead of in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a market! &lt;/p&gt;

In terms of news flow though it was light in North American trade as the data and Fedspeak calendar was mostly bare. Trump did a victory lap and showed no sign of hesitancy or reversing his position. We can only hope that he&apos;s fallen in love with green on the tape once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s some irony in celebrating a &apos;total reset&apos; when it was Trump that lit the fire six weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think anyone in markets has a great deal of confidence in where this is all headed or what will come next but for now there is a clear push to de-escalate. If you take a longer view, there&apos;s a good argument that the early moves were an attempt to stake out a minimalist negotiating position in order to negotiate back to a 10% tariff that at least some countries (like the UK) will swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were surely be more bumps in the road and there was some early profit taking in stock markets before the late bids re-emerged. The FX market was steadier though with USD/JPY barely backing off after rising above 148.00. The big moves in most pairs came today before European trading though we did see some continued selling of commodity currencies again the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big losers on the day were CHF and JPY, which is what you would expect in this environment. The market feels much better about the chances for global GDP growth and a re-coupling of world&apos;s two-largest economies in the 90 days ahead. I certainly don&apos;t believe that all the angst about Trump has dissipated but it&apos;s fair to price in something of Trump put again. I don&apos;t think it ever had to be this volatile but Trump has never been a stranger to drama.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs citing trade war developments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In light of these developments and the meaningful easing in financial conditions over the last month, we are raising our 2025 growth forecast by 0.5pp to 1% Q4/Q4 and reducing our 12-month recession odds to 35%. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now forecast a December FOMC rate cut instead of July&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We have lowered our core PCE inflation path to peak at 3.6% (vs. 3.8% previously)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Timiraos with the info. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier GS analysis of the trade war ceasefire:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The large reduction in the US tariff rate on China should only have a limited impact on the overall US effective tariff rate.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Sees “only a small (less than 2pp) decrease to the US’ current effective tariff rate from the relaxation in China tariffs.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“After accounting for a reduction of that magnitude, the full set of US tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the trade war ceasefire is good news, Trump stepping back from the brink of economic catastrophe at home and abroad, tariffs are still high - the highest since WW2. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US stock indices are sharply higher on US/China tariff news. Over the weekend the US slashed tariffs for the next 90-days on China goods from 145% to 30% inclusive of a 20% tariff due to fentanyl. The news led to sharp buying which did not abate. The broader S&amp;amp;P and Nasdaq indices had their 2nd best days going back to 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final numbers are showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average rose 1160.7 2.2 or 2.81% to 42,410.10.  That was the second-best day going back to November 6, 2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index rose 184.28 points or 3.26% at 5844.19. That was the 2nd-best % day going back to November 10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index rose 779.43 points or 4.35% at 18708.34. That was the second-best day since November 30.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Russell 2000 rose 16.12 points or 3.42% at 2092.19. For that index, it was a second-best day since November 6, 2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the bigger winners today included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;73&quot; data-end=&quot;111&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;75&quot; data-end=&quot;111&quot;&gt;Shopify Inc   +13.71%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;112&quot; data-end=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;114&quot; data-end=&quot;150&quot;&gt;First Solar  +11.07%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;151&quot; data-end=&quot;181&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;181&quot;&gt;Block   +9.29%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;182&quot; data-end=&quot;219&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;184&quot; data-end=&quot;219&quot;&gt;Lam Research   +9.18%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;220&quot; data-end=&quot;256&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;222&quot; data-end=&quot;256&quot;&gt;Amazon.com   +8.09%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;257&quot; data-end=&quot;297&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;259&quot; data-end=&quot;297&quot;&gt;Meta Platforms   +7.92%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;298&quot; data-end=&quot;327&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;300&quot; data-end=&quot;327&quot;&gt;Arm   +7.77%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;328&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;330&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot;&gt;Micron   +7.49%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;360&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;362&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot;&gt;Papa John’s   +7.26%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;397&quot; data-end=&quot;429&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;399&quot; data-end=&quot;429&quot;&gt;Gilead   +7.12%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;430&quot; data-end=&quot;461&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;432&quot; data-end=&quot;461&quot;&gt;FedEx   +6.94%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;462&quot; data-end=&quot;491&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;464&quot; data-end=&quot;491&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tesla   +6.82%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at some of the other leading gainers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alphabet +3.74%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft, +2.40%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nvidia, + 5.44%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nike  +7.34%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan &apos;Summary of Opinions&apos; for its most recent meeting, April 30 - May 1, is today.  Policy was left unchanged at this meeting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-japan-leaves-policy-unchanged-as-widely-expected-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan maintains its short term rate at 0.5%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The BoJ cited growing headwinds from higher US tariffs. The Bank cut its 2025 and 2026 economic growth forecasts in its quarterly outlook report.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll get more info on this meeting with the Summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;The Bank of Japan (BOJ) releases a &quot;Summary of Opinions&quot; after each monetary policy meeting. It serves as a record of the discussion and views of the Policy Board members on various economic and financial issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key points about the Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary includes the views of the Policy Board members on economic conditions, both domestically and globally. This includes assessments of economic growth, inflation, and employment trends, among other indicators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary also outlines the Policy Board members&apos; views on the effectiveness of the BOJ&apos;s current monetary policy measures, including interest rate policy, asset purchases, and yield curve control. Members may discuss the pros and cons of these policies and their potential impact on the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary includes discussions on the outlook for monetary policy and the potential risks to the economy. Board members may express their views on the appropriate timing and direction of future policy changes, as well as the potential impact of external factors such as global economic conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary also includes any dissenting views among the Policy Board members. If a member disagrees with the majority view on a particular issue, they may express their own opinion and rationale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a few week&apos;s time we&apos;ll get the Minutes of this meeting. The Minutes are a more detailed record of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Minutes include a more complete record of the views expressed, including any dissents or alternative opinions that may not be included in the summary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is typically released a few days after the policy meeting, while the Minutes are published about a month later. This means that the Summary of Opinions can provide more up-to-date information on the BOJ&apos;s current stance and view on the economy and monetary policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is usually written in a more accessible language, making it easier to understand the BOJ&apos;s views on monetary policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Minutes, on the other hand, are often more technical and may require a deeper understanding of economics and financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is typically shorter than the Minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;191&quot; data-end=&quot;480&quot;&gt;The EURUSD moved decisively lower today after breaking below a key support confluence on the 4-hour chart, which included the 200-bar moving average and a swing area between 1.12657 and 1.1273. That breakdown gave sellers the technical green light to extend the move to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;482&quot; data-end=&quot;714&quot;&gt;The next key target for sellers lies at the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally, which comes in at 1.10395. A move below this level would strengthen the bearish bias and open the door for further downside potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;716&quot; data-end=&quot;909&quot;&gt;If the price remains below the broken 1.1273–1.12657 zone and the 200-bar MA, sellers retain control in the short term. Holding below that area will be crucial for maintaining bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;911&quot; data-end=&quot;923&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;924&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;924&quot; data-end=&quot;982&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;926&quot; data-end=&quot;982&quot;&gt;Broke below 200-bar MA and swing zone at 1.12657–1.1273.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;983&quot; data-end=&quot;1040&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;985&quot; data-end=&quot;1040&quot;&gt;Next target: 1.10395 (38.2% retracement of 2025 rally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1041&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1043&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;Staying below 1.1273 keeps bearish bias intact. One&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Both the S&amp;amp;P and the NASDAQ indices surged on April 9 on the rebound from Liberation Day on April 2. For the NASDAQ index the price rose 12.16% on that day. For the S&amp;amp;P index the index rose 9.52%. If April 9 was the largest gain, today&apos;s gains in both those broad indices represent the second-largest gains going back to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the S&amp;amp;P is up 3.04%. On November 30, 2022 the index rose 3.10%. The NASDAQ index is up 4.01%. On November 30, 2022 the index rose 4.41%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, both the S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices are closing above both their 200 and 100 day moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; For the S&amp;amp;P index, the 200 day moving average comes in at 5750.30. The 100 day moving averages at 5773.88. The current price is at 5831.11&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the NASDAQ index, the 200 day moving averages at 18321.35. The 100 day is at 18477.63. The current price is at 18653.00&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the gains can be sustained into the close it would represent the first close above those moving averages since February 25. That would be a bullish development technically. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs and the uncertainty around President Trump’s policies still risked a combination of higher consumer prices and slower growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On China, it is definitely less impactful stagflationarily than the path they were on.  Yet it’s three to five times higher than what it was before, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is going to have a stagflationary impulse on the economy. It’s going to make growth slower and make prices rise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way that we’re doing this is not free for the economy,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Businesses he has spoken to want to make big investments and hire people, but the prospects that any of these negotiated tariff truces could lapse have made decisions like that much more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US/China statements are coming with explicit recognition that this isn’t permanent and that it’s going to be revisited in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of those announcements are explicitly putting off into the future major decisions, so that’s why it feels like there is in corporate America a lot of sitting on the hands. If they’re sitting on their hands, that backs into the wait-and-see posture of the Fed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed could afford to take its time before making any policy decisions. The labor market is still in solid shape, and there are not yet acute signs of strain. But the risks to inflation are not negligible, and it is still possible that tariffs of the nature that Mr. Trump is willing to keep in place could lead to a much more persistent problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what would concern him was if either the labor market started to deteriorate notably or expectations about inflation over a longer time horizon started to rise significantly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stagflation is a very uncomfortable situation for a central bank&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Patrick McGee writes in the Times of London today about the complexity of the relationships between Apple and China and how it contributed to China&apos;s rise while making Apple the most-valuable company in the world. Neither could have happened without the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is zero chance that Apple will ever leave China,&quot; writes McGee, who tomorrow will be out with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Apple-China-Capture-Greatest-Company/dp/1668053373&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; a book&lt;/a&gt; on Apple&apos;s rise in China. &quot;America lacks the experiential know-how, the dense population, the
 low wages or even the infrastructure to be competitive in manufacturing
 smartphones as complex as Apple’s.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple recently announced it would move assembly for its US-sold iPhones to India by 2026 but this aims to obfuscate that the components will still be built in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, President Trump highlighted that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning ahead of the tariff announcement. That&apos;s an acknowledgement that Apple had lobbied hard for the tariffs to go down and the company won. A frequent talking point of the tariffs was that &apos;no one wanted a $2000 iPhone&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is home to 90% of Apple&apos;s production, according to McGee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Washington has good reason to want to untie this knot, to convince
 Apple it should train workers in Ohio, not Zhengzhou. But the supply 
chain in question is the result of decades of Chinese investment, focus 
and tailor-made policies, supported by cutting-edge robotics, skills and
 experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares are up 6.1% today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $61.95. That is up $0.93 or 1.52%. The high price reached $63.57. The low price was at $61.04. The price is up for the third consecutive day. Since the low reached on May 5, the price is up 11.48%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, there is a swing area between $62.46 and $65.29 (see yellow area on the chart above).. In between that area lies the 50% midpoint of the range since the 2020 low. That level comes in at $64.71&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) U.S. POSTS $258B APRIL BUDGET SURPLUS, UP 23%

Strong tax payments and record import tariffs boosted the U.S. April surplus to $258B, Treasury reported.

🔸 $16B in customs duties, up $9B from last year.
🔸 U.S. collected $500M/day from tariffs, far below Trump&apos;s $2B/day claim.
🔸 Tariff revenue will fall as U.S.-China agreed to cut tariffs (U.S. to 30%, China to 10%) for 90 days.

For fiscal 2025 (Oct-Apr):

🔸 Deficit: $1.049T, up 23%.
🔸 Receipts: $3.11T, Outlays: $4.16T — both April records.
🔸 Adjusted for timing effects, the deficit rose 4%.</title>

That said, timing shifts around Easter and how the days of the week land in any given month can affect how many pay periods there are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These budget numbers are rarely a market mover but they&apos;re a good reminder that Congress will one day have to bring down spending or raise more money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) CHINA TRADE EASING DOESN&apos;T MEAN A QUICK FED CUT: DEUTSCHE BANK

A big drop in U.S.-China trade barriers lessens the prospects of a serious inflationary supply crunch. Even so, inflation remains stubborn enough that the Fed probably still won&apos;t be in a rush to cut interest rates, economists at Deutsche Bank write. Despite the trade war&apos;s easing, &quot;policies are likely to keep inflation at uncomfortably high levels for the Fed,&quot; Deutsche&apos;s team suggests. &quot;This announcement therefore reinforces our view that the Fed is going to be slow to cut rates this year.&quot; Deutsche&apos;s baseline assumption is that the Fed&apos;s next rate cut won&apos;t come before December</title>

      <title>Gold on pace for its worst day since November 2024</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The flight into gold is having a tough time today after the weekend news on tariff relief at least for the next 90 days between the US and China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price is currently down -$101 or -3.06% at $3224.21. The dollar decline is the largest one-day decline on record. On a percentage basis, the decline is the worst since the price fell -3.35% back on November 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, the low price from May 1 reached $3202.03. The low price today reach $3207.95 so far. Moving below that level should open the door for further downside momentum with the 38.2% retracement of the move up from the November 2024 low the next major target at $3132.16. Below that a trendline cuts across at $3082.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would take a while to get to the rising 100 day moving which is currently at $2953.80. That is also near the swing low going back to April 7 (I guess it wasn&apos;t that long ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading year, the price of gold is still up 22.83% after rising 27.22% in 2024 and 13.16% in 2023. If tariff risks decline, we could see a liquidation of the precious metal.&lt;/p&gt;
