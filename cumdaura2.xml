      <title>A technical pattern for the US 10 year? Holding above the 200 hour moving average</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;80&quot; data-end=&quot;518&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I analyze a chart, I look for technical levels that &quot;do their job&quot;—levels where the market consistently reacts. On the 10-year yield chart above, the 200-hour moving average has done just that. Over the past three tests, the yield has found reliable support at the 200-hour MA, with each bounce occurring at progressively higher levels. This upward sequence has taken the yield from a low of 4.125% to a high of 4.564% so far in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;520&quot; data-end=&quot;1011&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most recent test and rebound occurred earlier today at 4.43%, once again at the rising 200-hour MA. Currently, the yield is trading near the session highs at 4.489%, positioned above both the 100-hour MA at 4.477% and the 200-hour MA at 4.436%. As long as yields hold above both moving averages, the bias remains firmly tilted to the upside. A break below both—specifically a move under 4.436%—would shift that bias and open the door to further downside pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GBPUSD Technical Analysis: Buyers reclaim control with work to do.</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;99&quot; data-end=&quot;447&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD has reestablished a short-term bullish bias after a failed downside break last week. During that break, sellers had their shot as price moved below both the consolidation red box floor (see chart above), and then the  38.2% Fibonacci retracement (at 1.31603), but that break quickly reversed. The inability to sustain the move lower - and the base at the 38.2% after the failed break -  gave buyers the green light to step back in—and they did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;99&quot; data-end=&quot;447&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price moved back above the 100-hour MA (see blue line on the chart above) on Tuesday of last week, and apart from a failed break below it, and a swing level at 1.3259 on Friday, the buyers remained in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;449&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday,  the price pushed back above the 100-hour moving average (1.3315 currently) and also away from the 200-hour moving average (1.32854 currently), confirming the rejection of the bearish move and reinforcing bullish momentum. The 100-hour MA is now acting as dynamic support, keeping the near-term upside bias intact. Staying above is more bullish. That is close support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;745&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price action today (and going back to the extreme from yesterday), has seen up-and-down volatility.  There is a swing area between 1.33619 to 1.33784, which has been a messy resistance area this week with failed breaks.  However, the high price from yesterday did find willing sellers near the high from May 6 at 1.34018. That increases the levels importance going forward.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;745&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get and stay above 1.33784 adn then the 1.34018 will then target highs for the year at 1.3423, 1.3433 (high from 2024) and 1.34413 (high for the year). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move below the 100 hour MA at 1.3315 takes some of the wind out of the buyers sails. Below that, the 200 hour MA at 1.3285 would need to be broken to add to selling momentu. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP TO APPOINT GEN. GUETLEIN TO LEAD $831B &apos;GOLDEN DOME&apos; MISSILE SHIELD

President Trump plans to name Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein to lead the &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; a new missile defense system aimed at protecting the U.S. from advanced threats like hypersonic weapons and low-flying missiles. The system would blend existing interceptors with satellite-based defenses.

The project could cost up to $831 billion over 20 years, with $25 billion proposed in the next budget. Guetlein, a space and missile defense expert, has warned of growing threats from China and backs increased U.S. space investments.

Trump is pushing for a fast rollout, prioritizing components that can be completed during his term. The &quot;Golden Dome&quot; will combine traditional and emerging defense technologies.</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;66&quot; data-end=&quot;369&quot;&gt;BofA highlights that corporate hedging behavior in G10 FX, particularly in EUR/USD, may shift meaningfully if the euro continues to strengthen. Corporates appear underhedged against EUR exposure, and further euro gains could prompt catch-up hedging, influencing spot markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;371&quot; data-end=&quot;386&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;388&quot; data-end=&quot;1042&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;388&quot; data-end=&quot;576&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;390&quot; data-end=&quot;576&quot;&gt;Corporate flows dominate BofA’s proprietary FX flow data, but have been relatively light and directionless so far this year, suggesting a wait-and-see stance despite price moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;578&quot; data-end=&quot;718&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;580&quot; data-end=&quot;718&quot;&gt;BofA identifies a notable negative EUR exposure among corporates, meaning many are short EUR or reliant on weak EUR scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;720&quot; data-end=&quot;849&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;722&quot; data-end=&quot;849&quot;&gt;That negative exposure has slightly increased in 2025, implying limited proactive hedging despite EUR/USD appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;851&quot; data-end=&quot;1042&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;853&quot; data-end=&quot;1042&quot;&gt;If EUR/USD strength persists, corporates may be forced to hedge more actively, potentially reinforcing EUR upside in a nonlinear and counterintuitive way due to flow imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1044&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1044&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;Corporate FX exposure in EUR/USD is a latent market driver. If the euro continues to rally, underhedged corporates may accelerate demand for EUR hedges, introducing a positive feedback loop that could drive further EUR strength, especially in thin liquidity environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1044&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;For bank trade ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747839401358000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0fNnhuAYYD4ra2HI_SSSNU&quot;&gt;check out eFX Plus&lt;/a&gt;.

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology sector today paints a varied picture. Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are down 0.71% and 0.67% respectively, reflecting some bearish sentiments. Particularly hit is the semiconductor space, with Nvidia (NVDA) facing a decline of 2.02%, signalling caution from investors about tech valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the consumer cyclical sector shows some resilience, boosted by Tesla (TSLA) with a rise of 0.97%. Yet, not all experienced gains, as Amazon (AMZN) dropped by 1.09%. Communication services also faced headwinds, with both Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) showing slight dips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial Sector Resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the financial sector remains relatively stable. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edges up 0.40%, reflecting market confidence in financial services, while some others like American Express (AXP) dip slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market mood today seems cautious yet optimistic, with investors selectively showing confidence in industries like auto manufacturing and industrial goods. This balance highlights ongoing uncertainties, possibly stemming from broader economic factors, like interest rates and global economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For traders and investors, it might be wise to look into diversified portfolio strategies, emphasizing those sectors showing individual resilience. Industrial names such as Boeing (BA), up by 1.39%, illustrate potential trends for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aligning investment strategies with these dynamics—considering high-quality financials or robust industrials—could prove beneficial. Be wary of abrupt shifts in tech sentiment or regulatory news that can impact these recovering markets intensely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic landscape suggests maintaining vigilance over real-time market data might uncover short-term opportunities.

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;220&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD continues to trade within a well-defined range, with price action capped once again at the resistance zone between 1.1265 and 1.1275—a level that has repeatedly stalled upside attempts. Buyers briefly pushed through this zone yesterday, reaching a high at 1.1280, but failed to hold above, and the pair has since rotated lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;568&quot; data-end=&quot;975&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the retreat, the downside remains limited. Today’s low was supported ahead of a key confluence of moving averages, with the 100-hour MA at 1.1207 and the 200-hour MA at 1.1199 acting as the current barometer for downside momentum. A sustained move below these levels would tilt the bias more firmly in favor of sellers, exposing support targets at 1.1145, followed by the low from last week at 1.1064.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;1264&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the flip side, buyers still have a chance while the pair holds above the 100/200-hour MAs. To regain broader control, EURUSD would need to break convincingly above the 1.1265–1.1275 resistance zone, and then the swing high from yesterday at 1.1280, to open the door toward 1.1344 area (trend line)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1266&quot; data-end=&quot;1393&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the short-term bias is modestly bullish above the key moving averages, but a directional breakout is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1400&quot; data-end=&quot;1417&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;🔑 Key Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1419&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1419&quot; data-end=&quot;1593&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1421&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1441&quot; data-end=&quot;1593&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1441&quot; data-end=&quot;1472&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1443&quot; data-end=&quot;1472&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1265–1.1275 (key ceiling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1475&quot; data-end=&quot;1510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1477&quot; data-end=&quot;1510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1280 (swing high from May 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1513&quot; data-end=&quot;1558&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1515&quot; data-end=&quot;1558&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1344 (trend line)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1561&quot; data-end=&quot;1593&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1563&quot; data-end=&quot;1593&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1402 (next extension target)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1595&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1597&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1638&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1616&quot; data-end=&quot;1638&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1207 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1641&quot; data-end=&quot;1665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1643&quot; data-end=&quot;1665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1199 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1668&quot; data-end=&quot;1690&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1670&quot; data-end=&quot;1690&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1145 (swing level)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1693&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1695&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1063 (low from last week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1693&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1695&quot; data-end=&quot;1722&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.10395 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1729&quot; data-end=&quot;1743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;📊 Bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1744&quot; data-end=&quot;1865&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1744&quot; data-end=&quot;1788&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1746&quot; data-end=&quot;1788&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Modestly bullish above hourly MAs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1789&quot; data-end=&quot;1817&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1791&quot; data-end=&quot;1817&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish below 1.1199&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1818&quot; data-end=&quot;1865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1820&quot; data-end=&quot;1865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bullish breakout confirmed above 1.1280&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;REMINDER.

That area increases the areas importance. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bank of Canada rate cut odds plumment. Eyes now on next week&apos;s GDP data</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The implied odds of a Bank of Canada rate cut on June 4 have plunged to 36% from 65% following today&apos;s CPI report. The main problem was that core measures rose 0.2-0.3 pp more than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Diverging signals within today&apos;s inflation data produces a real dilemma for the Bank of Canada,&quot; writes CIBC following the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They note that headline inflation fell because of the removal of the carbon tax but core measures accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we previously expected that a
renewed weakening within the labour market would bring a 25bp cut from the Bank of Canada at its June meeting,
that call now relies on next week&apos;s GDP data suggesting that the economy is tracking towards contraction in Q2,&quot; CIBC writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food, rent and travel-tour prices were sources of rising price pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/CAD is down 8 pips to 1.3942 today in choppy trade as Canada returns from a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;No one cares about the deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Trump is on Capitol Hill speaking with Republicans and trying to push forward his budget bill. Yet he singled out one single Republican holdout: Thomas Massie and called for him to be voted out of office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massie&apos;s sin? He wants to see real deficit reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other reports said that in the meeting, Trump told Republicans: “don’t f*ck around with Medicaid”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, that had been the lever to pull for at least some offsets to the deficit. I think that comment has pushed up yields and -- in particular -- gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Moody&apos;s downgrade certainly wasn&apos;t ahead of the curve or telling us anything we don&apos;t already know but it was an opportunity to rally the deficit hawks and change course, or at least nudge it in a more-responsible direction. Instead, it&apos;s full-steam ahead on forever deficits with no credible path towards improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US 30-year yields bounced off 5% yesterday but are now up 3 bps to 4.97% today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;91&quot; data-end=&quot;559&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD is currently caught in a technical stranglehold, with price action confined between a dense cluster of key moving averages across multiple timeframes. On the topside, rallies have repeatedly stalled near the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart at 0.59273, a level that has served as firm resistance over the past two days. Just below that, the 200-hour MA at 0.59025 and the 100-hour MA at 0.58996 are acting as a short-term pivot for the buyers and sellers (below is a bearish tilt/above is a bullish tilt)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;561&quot; data-end=&quot;891&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the pair is supported by the converged 200-day moving average and the 200-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, both of which are rising and now aligned near 0.5880–0.5881.

A move above would shift the bias more bullishly toward the 0.5968 level (high from last week), while a break below could trigger a rotation back toward 0.5852 to 0.5860 (swing area) followed by the 38.2% retracement level at 0.58204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1273&quot; data-end=&quot;1290&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;🔑 Key Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1292&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1292&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1294&quot; data-end=&quot;1311&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1314&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1314&quot; data-end=&quot;1339&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1316&quot; data-end=&quot;1339&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.59273 (100-bar MA on 4-hour)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1407&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1409&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5950, 0.5968 (high from last week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1440&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1442&quot; data-end=&quot;1456&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1482&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1461&quot; data-end=&quot;1482&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5881 (200-day MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1485&quot; data-end=&quot;1518&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1487&quot; data-end=&quot;1518&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5880 (200-bar MA on 4-hour)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1521&quot; data-end=&quot;1551&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1523&quot; data-end=&quot;1551&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5852-0.5860 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1554&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1556&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5820 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1597&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;📉 Bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1612&quot; data-end=&quot;1736&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1612&quot; data-end=&quot;1667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neutral while trapped between 0.5880 and 0.5927.

                            &lt;p&gt;Oil prices are under pressure after a Reuters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/kazakhstans-oil-output-rises-2-may-defiance-opec-2025-05-20/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reporting &lt;/a&gt;saying that Kazakhstan has boosted oil production by 2% so far this month. The country is in a battle with OPEC over compensatory cuts it&apos;s promised but failed to deliver after over-producing quotas. The report cites an industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher production has led to OPEC speeding up the planned return of barrels and with this move, that acceleration is likely to continue. Oil prices have come under pressure in the past hour and this report is weighing further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kazakhstan is taking all measures to comply with OPEC+ obligations and compensate for excess production,&quot; the oil ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said monthly production is at 1.86 mbpd compared to the quota of 1.486 mbpd.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Teranet April Canadian house price index fell 1.5% in April in the fourth consecutive monthly decline, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In year-over-year terms, prices eked out a 0.2% gain nationally after a 2.3% increase the month before. There is strength in Quebec while the Toronto area is struggling with the city down 3.5% y/y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s CPI report won&apos;t help as it&apos;s dimmed the pricing for a June cut to just 39%. Canadian benchmark 5-year rates are also up to 2.88%, which is near the top end of the range since February.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;104&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF is trading with a modest bearish tilt in the short term, as price remains capped below a key confluence zone around 0.8363. This level marks the intersection of the 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages, as well as a downward sloping trend line — making it a clearly defined bias-defining level. As long as the pair remains below this zone, sellers hold the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;506&quot; data-end=&quot;880&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, the downside momentum has yet to fully assert itself. Sellers had an opportunity to drive the pair lower below a well-tested swing area floor between 0.8318 and 0.8333, but that move ultimately failed. The quick rebound from that zone suggests buyers are still defending that support base, which has now reestablished itself as the key short-term floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;882&quot; data-end=&quot;1226&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above 0.8363 would shift the bias back in favor of the bulls, exposing the 0.8400–0.8420 zone and potentially the 38.2% retracement of the decline from the January 2025 high (high for the year - not shown) at 0.8483. Conversely, a confirmed break below 0.8318 would likely accelerate downside pressure toward the next support targets at 0.8273 and 0.82803&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1233&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;🔑 Key Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1512&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1410&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1254&quot; data-end=&quot;1271&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1274&quot; data-end=&quot;1410&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1274&quot; data-end=&quot;1325&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1276&quot; data-end=&quot;1325&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8363 (100/200-hour MA + trendline confluence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1328&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1330&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8400 (round number / swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1379&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1371&quot; data-end=&quot;1379&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8433 (high from May 15)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1382&quot; data-end=&quot;1410&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1384&quot; data-end=&quot;1410&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8476 to 0.8483 (high from last week and 38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1412&quot; data-end=&quot;1512&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1414&quot; data-end=&quot;1428&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1431&quot; data-end=&quot;1512&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1431&quot; data-end=&quot;1473&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1433&quot; data-end=&quot;1473&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8333–0.8318 (key floor / swing zone)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1476&quot; data-end=&quot;1486&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1478&quot; data-end=&quot;1486&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8273-0.8280 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1489&quot; data-end=&quot;1499&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1491&quot; data-end=&quot;1499&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.8195 to 0.8212 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1519&quot; data-end=&quot;1533&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;📉 Bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1534&quot; data-end=&quot;1708&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1534&quot; data-end=&quot;1587&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1536&quot; data-end=&quot;1587&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish below 0.8363, with sellers in control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1588&quot; data-end=&quot;1644&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1590&quot; data-end=&quot;1644&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bullish above 0.8363, break would target 0.8400+&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1645&quot; data-end=&quot;1708&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1647&quot; data-end=&quot;1708&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Downside target zone: 0.8318–0.8333, awaiting directional break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;224&quot; data-end=&quot;602&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD continues to trade in a narrow consolidation range, with price action toggling above and below the 100-hour (1.39607) and 200-hour (1.39501) moving averages — a sign of short-term indecision. In early North American trading, the pair briefly tested the 100-hour MA but failed to sustain gains, attracting sellers and keeping the near-term bias tilted to the downside.The Canada CPI data was higher than expected which is helping to give the CAD some support (lower USDCAD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;604&quot; data-end=&quot;975&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the broader chart, last week’s price action showed two failed attempts to break above the 200-day moving average near 1.40157, reinforcing that level as a key resistance zone. To shift control back to the buyers, USDCAD would need to move decisively above the 1.4015–1.4027 area, and ideally extend toward the 38.2% retracement of the March decline at 1.40525.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;1290&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the meantime, the pair bias more bearish with the price below neutral zone MA area between 1.3960–1.3950 (it is the pivot today). Below, the 1.3891–1.3904 region, previously a ceiling, is now serving as support. A break below that area would solidify a bearish bias and expose further downside toward 1.3860 and possibly 1.3832.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1297&quot; data-end=&quot;1314&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;🔑 Key Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1316&quot; data-end=&quot;1614&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1316&quot; data-end=&quot;1497&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1318&quot; data-end=&quot;1335&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1497&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1377&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1340&quot; data-end=&quot;1377&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3960– (100-hour MA / pivot)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1380&quot; data-end=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1382&quot; data-end=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.4015–1.4027 (200-day MA / swing highs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1427&quot; data-end=&quot;1472&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1429&quot; data-end=&quot;1472&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.40525 (38.2% retracement of March high)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1499&quot; data-end=&quot;1614&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1501&quot; data-end=&quot;1515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1518&quot; data-end=&quot;1614&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1545&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1547&quot; data-end=&quot;1590&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3904–1.3891 (former ceiling, now floor)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1593&quot; data-end=&quot;1603&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1595&quot; data-end=&quot;1603&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3860&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1621&quot; data-end=&quot;1635&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;📉 Bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1636&quot; data-end=&quot;1761&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1636&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1638&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish below 1.3950 to 1.39607&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1678&quot; data-end=&quot;1706&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1680&quot; data-end=&quot;1706&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish below 1.3891&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1707&quot; data-end=&quot;1761&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1709&quot; data-end=&quot;1761&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bullish only on a sustained break above 1.40156 (200 day MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar is on the front foot in early New York trade. The pound is at a session low against the dollar, down 14 pips to 1.3343 after rising as high as 1.3394 at the start of European trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUD and NZD are also sliding after the RBA cut rates earlier and indicated there was a discussion about cutting by 50 bps. That has both as laggards today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big concern today is sovereign yields after Japanese 30-year yields went parabolic following a poor 20-year auction. The moves comes after Japan PM took an austere tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our country’s fiscal situation is undoubtedly extremely poor,” he said, “worse than Greece’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&apos;re not supposed to say the quiet part out loud, particularly when your borrowing costs have been marching steadily higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s leading to some USD safe-haven buying but eyes are also on Treasury yields US 30s fell as low as 4.89% earlier but have crept back to 4.96% and are trading at a session high. There has been demand recent on every tick to 5% but at some point you run out of buyers, particularly with the President trying to coax Congress towards an even-larger deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

That contributed to an 18.1% y/y decline in gasoline prices with natural gas prices down 14.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market was pricing in a 65% chance of a BOC rate cut in early June ahead of this data but that&apos;s quickly back to 51%. These core numbers are uncomfortably hot and may represent some trade war pass-thru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source of inflation was in food with grocery stores up 3.8% y/y and restaurant prices up 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/CAD has quickly fallen to 1.3935 from 1.3960 on the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is little changed vs the EUR (-0.05%), JPY (-0.17%), and GBP (-0.06%) to start the US trading session.  The USD is also marginally lower vs the CHF and the CAD.  The biggest move in the US morning snapshot is versus the AUD with the dollar higher vs that currency aftet the RBA cut rates by 25 basis points, but did talk of cutting by 50 basis points. That gave the sellers an incentive to push the pair lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN summary, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its cash rate target to 3.85% from 4.10%, as expected, citing continued easing in inflation. While headline inflation may temporarily rise due to short-term factors, underlying inflation is forecasted to remain near the midpoint of the 2–3% target range. The RBA acknowledged ongoing global uncertainty stemming from tariff policy shifts and their potential impact on economic activity. Despite signs of recovery in private domestic demand and persistently tight labor market conditions, the Board views inflation risks as more balanced. With inflation now within the target band and upside pressures easing, the Board judged a rate cut appropriate to make policy less restrictive. However, it remains cautious and will closely monitor global and domestic developments to guide future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA Governor Bullock stated that the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia is prepared to take further rate actions if necessary, noting that price increases have slowed. She described the latest move as a confident rate cut and revealed that the Board discussed a range of options, including a 50 basis point or 25 basis point cut, as well as the possibility of holding rates steady. Ultimately, the consensus favored a 25bps cut, which she called the right move for now, although further adjustments remain on the table. Bullock noted that businesses are reporting margin pressures, and while there was some support for a larger 50bps cut, it was not the dominant view. She emphasized that it’s unclear whether this cut will lead to a longer series of reductions and clarified that the RBA does not endorse current market pricing, which anticipates around 55bps of cuts by year-end. Bullock added that if inflation continues to decline, it would create room for additional rate reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video above, I take a look at the four currency pairs from a technical perspective to kickstart your trading day in the USD.  What levels are in play and why. Be aware. Be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other central banker talk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB&apos;s Klaas Knot stated that the mid-term inflation outlook remains too uncertain to commit to a rate cut in June. While he acknowledged that upcoming ECB projections are likely to show lower inflation for 2025 and 2026, the long-term trajectory of inflation is unclear. This uncertainty is making it difficult to determine the appropriate course of monetary policy at this stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB&apos;s Isabel Schnabel commented that disinflation remains on track, but new external shocks are complicating the policy outlook. She noted that while tariffs could have a short-term disinflationary effect, they introduce upside inflation risks over the medium term. Schnabel also highlighted that the Euro’s recent appreciation presents a strategic opportunity to strengthen its role as a global currency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB&apos;s Jose Luis Escrivá emphasized that the global financial environment is being shaped by heightened geopolitical tensions, evolving trade disputes, and increasingly unpredictable policy moves by the U.S. administration. He warned that these dynamics could pose risks to financial system stability. According to some scenarios, while higher tariffs may impact the U.S. more significantly, the Eurozone could also face secondary effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BoE’s Huw Pill described his recent vote against an interest rate cut as a &quot;skip&quot; rather than a reversal, emphasizing it was part of a continued, cautious withdrawal of monetary policy tightening. He expressed concern over persistent inflation pressures, noting that the structural changes in wage and price-setting behavior have made inflation in the UK more stubborn. Pill argued that the current pace of quarterly 25 bps cuts, ongoing since last summer, is too aggressive given the risks to price stability and the strength of some pay indicators. While he believes the broader disinflation process remains intact and agrees with the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) overall outlook, he advocated for a more measured approach to rate reductions. He stressed that future cuts should be cautious and not overly reliant on short-term data surprises, especially in a climate where new economic shocks could prolong inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are lower with the futures implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures are unchanged versus the close&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures are implying a decline of -8.85 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures are implying a decline of -53 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets, the major indices are higher at the start of the US session:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, +.55%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, +0.63%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, +0.67%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, +1.52%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, +0.72&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are marginally lower. Yesterday, yields moved higher at the start of the day on the back of the Moody&apos;s downgrade, but reversed and closed little changed by the close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.968%, -1.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.068%, -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.469%, -0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.939%, -0.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil down $0.16 or -0.30% at $61.95&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is up $6.18 or 0.19% at $3236.41&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading dow, -$527 at $105,085&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The RBA cut rate earlier today and the market is sensing that the Bank of Canada will continue to do the same. Their next meeting is June 4 and market pricing is now at 65% for a cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big swing in that could come at the bottom of the hour with Canadian inflation data via the CPI report for April. The consensus is for a 0.2% m/m decline on the headline to knock the y/y all the way to 1.6% from 2.3%. What could keep the BOC sidelined is hotter core number with the median measure expected steady at 2.9% and trim forecast to tick up to 2.9% from 2.8%.&lt;/p&gt;

The only highlight was the RBA policy decision where the central bank cut interest rates by 25 bps as expected and lowered growth and inflation forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AUD fell initially on the dovish forecasts but eventually bounced back. The Aussie dollar couldn&apos;t sustain the pressure though after RBA&apos;s Governor Bullock mentioned that they debated between a 25 and 50 bps cut. That sent the AUD to new lows and the market increased the easing expectations for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, we got some ECB speakers that are now starting to change their tone around the need for further cuts. The hawks are particularly wary of overdoing it on rate cuts and not reach their inflation target on a sustained basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the Canadian CPI 
report where the Trimmed Mean Y/Y is expected at 2.9% vs. 2.8% prior and
 the Median Y/Y is seen at 2.9% vs. 2.9% prior. The market is pricing a 
62% chance of a 25 bps cut at the upcoming meeting and a total of 47 bps
 of easing by year-end. A higher than expected reading could see the 
market price out a rate cut at the upcoming meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
 will also have some more Fedspeak and the focus will be on potential 
hawkish comments as the market is now back at pricing just two rate cuts
 in 2025. From now on, we will either price in more cuts or less cuts 
than expected and that will move markets.&lt;/p&gt;

We got some rate cuts recently and that certainly gives some support to the economy, but I would like them to go bigger on rate cuts given that they still have positive real rates amid deflationary forces.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 54 bps (91% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 52 bps (93% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 45 bps (84% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 47 bps (64% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 73 bps (56% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 58 bps (82% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 47 bps (81% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;*for the SNB, the rest of the probability is for a 50 bps cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 17 bps (98% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing remained roughly unchanged for most central banks except the RBA where we saw a more dovish repricing after Governor Bullock&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/rba-governor-bullock-did-discuss-25-bps-or-50-bps-cut-20250520/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;50 bps comment&lt;/a&gt; today (it was 57 bps before that comment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now at a point where the market got back to previous expectations and from now on we will need stronger reasons to price out the rate cuts. That will obviously move the markets. Of course the same is true for pricing in more rate cuts than currently expected.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mid-term inflation outlook too uncertain to say whether we need a June cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB projections likely to show lower inflation this year and the next, but longer term is uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally think the ECB shouldn&apos;t cut in June and pause now to see how things evolve. There&apos;s a scenario where they might have already over-eased and could struggle to bring inflation sustainably back to target.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan mulls accepting US tariff reduction, not exemption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyodo News is reporting the Japan is considering accepting a reduction in tariffs and not pushing too much for exemptions. The aim is to break through the stagnation in US-Japan trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan&apos;s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, could travel to Washington
 as soon as next week for a third round of trade talks with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://nordot.app/1297480276588232924&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the article&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don&apos;t think nuclear talks with the US will be successful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US demand that Iran stops enrichment is outrageous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US should avoid talking nonsense in talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This headline gave crude oil prices a boost as the markets continue to bounce around amid the US-Iran nuclear deal. A positive resolution is seen as bearish (at least in the near term) due to higher supply expectations. Conversely, negative outcomes are seen as bullish.&lt;/p&gt;
