                            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today there was a concerning escalation with  Indian cruise missiles hitting Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase. Earlier, there was also an Indian military facility in Beas hit by Pakistan, supposedly destroying a storage facility for Brahmos missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t confirm any of those reports but it looks like cooler heads have prevailed with both nuclear powers now declaring an immediate ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

We&apos;ll just have to see how it goes on the weekend and what China wants and is willing to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the world: The big question is &apos;who is willing to accept 10% and who isn&apos;t?&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

The US dollar generally sagged and that might reflect so anxiety about the US-China meeting scheduled for the weekend. Trump floated an 80% tariff rate for China so we&apos;ll see where that all lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, it likely tees up a big move to start next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro was strong early in US trade and continues higher to 1.1292 before stalling ahead of the figure and steadily retreating back to 1.1250 last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/JPY fell at the same time to a session low of 144.83 before recovering 50 pips. It remains the main source of FX volatility as the market weighs tariff outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one comment from Williams that stood out to me was him highlighting &apos;considerably&apos; slower growth coming. That&apos;s a different tune from Powell, who repeatedly emphasized the strength in economic data to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for economic reports, the lone notable one was from Canada. The headline was slightly better than expected but the report showed 37K public admin jobs added in what was largely temporary hiring for the election that will unwind in the month ahead. The unemployment rate rose to 6.9% from 6.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to some Canadian dollar underperformance, though not in a big way is it&apos;s mostly the trade war that&apos;s driving moves.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US yields moved modestly higher for the 2nd consecutive week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.883%, up 6.1 basis points for the week. That comes after a 6.6 basis point gain last week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.994%, up 7.7 basis points for the week. Last week yields rose 4.0 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.382% up 7.4 basis points for the week.

                            &lt;p&gt;According to Reuters,:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iran is preparing to send Russia launchers for short range ballistic missiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a negative for two reasons.  For one, the US is trying to put a governor on Iran and have them get more in line.  The second isssue is the US and Trump administration is getting increasingly frustrated with Russia&apos;s behavior with regard to promises made and broken in Ukraine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So two bad actors are potentially acting up.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US crude oil futures are settling the day at $61.02. That&apos;s $1.11 or 1.85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading day. The high was at $61.42. The low was at $59.92. The price moved up $3.07 or 4.46% for the trading week but it wasn&apos;t until after reaching a low of $55.39 which was just above the low price for the year $55.15 from the week of April 7, and the lowest price going back to February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the hourly chart, the price rebound has extended up toward the 38.2% retracement of the range since the April high (high price reached $72.22). The 38.2% retracement comes in at $61.63. Getting above that level is needed to increase the bullish bias from a technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, the 100 and 200-hour moving averages are near each other above and below the $59 level. The 100-hour moving average is starting to move to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Polls have shown that Greenlanders are dead-against joining the USA but the Trump administration is looking to find another way to pull the island closer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us-weighs-special-status-greenland-quest-island-intensifies-2025-05-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to a Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While the precise details of COFA agreements - which have only ever been
 extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall 
Islands and Palau - vary depending on the signatory, the U.S. government
 typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;145&quot; data-end=&quot;423&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, AUDUSD broke above a key swing area and the upper boundary of a consolidation range dating back to April 15, moving as high as 0.65135. The bullish breakout included a move above the 200-day moving average at 0.64587, signaling strong buying interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;425&quot; data-end=&quot;622&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, momentum faded. Following the Fed rate decision on Wednesday, the pair fell back below the 200-day MA, and on Thursday, a corrective rally stalled right at that key MA level as sellers leaned in and stalled the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;624&quot; data-end=&quot;860&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In today’s Asian session, buyers stepped in at a rising trendline support, helping to lift the pair back above the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart. But gains were capped once again near the 200-hour MA at 0.64291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking ahead, AUDUSD faces a cluster of resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;917&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-hour MA: 0.64291&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;944&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;946&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;100-hour MA: 0.64459&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;973&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;975&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-day MA: 0.64588&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1001&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Swing area (red box): 0.6429–0.6442&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1046&quot; data-end=&quot;1309&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite recent pullbacks, the pair remains closer to the highs for the year. Holding above the trendline and 4-hour 100-bar MA is constructive, but buyers need to reclaim and sustain a move above the 200-day MA to regain full control and build bullish confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NZDUSD attempted a downside break today, falling below key swing support and the 200-day moving average 0.58836, but after reaching a low of 0.5869, the price quickly rebounded, disappointing the sellers.  The price  is now showing signs of stabilization with the buyers pushing back higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers had their shot below 0..5883 to 0.58927. They missed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;483&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this week (Wednesday), the pair moved to a high near the April highs at 0.60281 (the high reached 0.6022), suggesting strong resistance remains at the upper boundary of the consolidation range. So buyers had their shot as well, but they failed to extend higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;483&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In between the support at 0.58836 and the resistance at 0.6028, is a cluster of moving averages (100-hour, 200-hour, and 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart) around 0.5945–0.5955 now sits near the middle of the recent range and represents a key barrier for buyers on any rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;830&quot; data-end=&quot;1039&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, price action remains trapped between resistance near 0.6018 and support around 0.5886. A break outside this range—particularly with momentum—will be needed to define the next directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1041&quot; data-end=&quot;1065&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1066&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1066&quot; data-end=&quot;1112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1068&quot; data-end=&quot;1112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5886–0.5893 (200-day MA zone)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1113&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1115&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.5950–0.5965 (MA cluster), then 0.6018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1171&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish confirmation: Sustained break below 0.5886 opens room toward 0.5820 and 0.5771&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD is extending higher as dollar selling gathers momentum.  Stocks are lower with the S&amp;amp;P and Nasdaq indices now down -0.10%.  The US yields are lower with the 10-year now down -2.0 basis points. The 2 year is down -5.0 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;79&quot; data-end=&quot;599&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD broke below a consolidation zone between 1.3232 and 1.3241 earlier today, after holding that area as support in yesterday’s trade. The downside momentum carried the pair toward a key swing area between 1.32017 and 1.32067—a zone that acted as resistance and later support during the first half of April. Notably, the price based near that level on April 17 before launching a rally that reached the 2024 high at 1.3433, and briefly extended to the cycle high of 1.34413—the highest since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since that peak, price action has been volatile and rangebound. Today&apos;s downside break was significant, but lacked follow-through selling, and buyers have since stepped back in, pushing the pair higher. The rebound is now testing the 100-hour moving average at 1.33078 and the 200-hour moving average at 1.33168—key intraday resistance levels that will help determine whether buyers can regain short-term control (see blue and green lines on the chart above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The moving average levels are midrange barometers or more bullish more bearish. Admittedly, earlier this week, the price traded above and below the moving averages – especially during yesterday&apos;s volatile up and down trading. Nevertheless, a move above would be a tilt more in the bullish direction from a technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, find willing sellers here, and the price remains in the bottom portion of the range.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electric vehicle surge: Tesla powers ahead while tech and healthcare struggle</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market today presents a mixed tableau of sector performances, with electric vehicles taking center stage. Tesla (TSLA) leads the charge in the auto manufacturer space with a robust gain of 6.40%. This significant upswing is indicative of bullish sentiment surrounding the company, possibly fueled by positive sales figures or advancements in battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology: Overall, the tech sector is experiencing a subdued day. Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants show slight declines, while Oracle (ORCL) manages a small gain of 0.27%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semiconductors: The sector faces challenges, with Nvidia (NVDA) seeing a decline of 0.92%. This drop points toward continued caution among investors in the semiconductor landscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: It&apos;s a mixed bag today, with AbbVie (ABBV) rising by 1.78%, showcasing its stability amidst volatile market dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical: Amazon (AMZN) remains stable with a modest increase of 0.12%, reinforcing its resilience in the consumer market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financials: Visa (V) edges up by 0.18%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 0.10%, reflecting tepid optimism in financial services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market sentiment today appears to be one of cautious optimism. The positive performance by Tesla highlights growing investor confidence in sustainable energy and transportation alternatives. However, the broader mixed signals, especially in tech and healthcare, indicate investor apprehension toward potential disruptions or policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in major tech companies like Google (GOOG) at -0.81% further underscores the tentative market attitude toward the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investors, it may be prudent to consider rebalancing portfolios to include more exposure to the electric vehicle sector and related sustainable energy investments. Tesla’s surge suggests momentum that could yield favorable returns. Adopting a diversified strategy might safeguard against the volatility observed in tech and healthcare stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, staying informed on semiconductor trends is essential, given the ongoing fluctuations. Investors might explore opportunities outside of traditional tech, particularly in sectors showing sustainability growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, investors are urged to keep an eye on real-time data and market analyses for timely adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The funny thing about wonk economists is that they rarely look past the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 145% tariffs on China (or today&apos;s Trump-floated number of 80%), they crunch the numbers and trade with China essentially stops. They run that through their models and that spits out assumptions around economic growth and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same thing when everyone announced sanctions on Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened in reality? Cheating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still get anything you want in Russia as the goods are simply shipped through a Russia-friendly country that then re-exports them. Otherwise, local officials turn a blind eye to where their own companies are shipping: After all, cutting exports means cutting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on today&apos;s Chinese trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-january-april-yuan-denominated-exports-75-yy-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, it hasn&apos;t taken long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese exports to the US in today&apos;s trade report fell 21% but rose by an equal percentage with south-east Asian nations and the EU. The largest increases were with Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/how-did-us-tariffs-impact-chinas-latest-trade-numbers-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; this earlier and has been way ahead on this angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone is up-in-arms about the trade war the reality might be far more benign: The labels are changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect that the greatest bull market in the world right now is importing Chinese goods, changing the labels and re-exporting to the US. It&apos;s in almost everyone&apos;s best interest to look the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think this is all taboo to talk about in economic circles, maybe it should remain that way. Just no one tell Trump and the global economy can continue to hum along.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks with Americans encouraging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have the impression the US is looking for tailor-made solutions with countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause on tariffs not to be lifted during negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today the American side &apos;clearly committed&apos; to accelerating talks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switzerland does not subsidize industry, but other countries may, these are the points the US is interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switzerland is now in a group of countries that are now treated swiftly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has a large trade surplus with the United States and that&apos;s led to a 31% tariff on Swiss imports that&apos;s been lowered to 10% until July 8. That said, the imbalance is much smaller when excluding gold and gold trade is something that Trump referred to yesterday in the UK deal.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;EURUSD broke below a key floor area yesterday near 1.1256–1.1265 and is now retesting that level from the underside (see red numbered circles).This area is also where the 61.8% of the range since 2020 high is found (at 1.1271) and the July 2023 high is at 1.12754). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;More recently, this zone, acted as a support floor, and is a critical pivot point. Staying below it will keep sellers in control in the short term and validate the downside break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;754&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier today, the pair found support at a swing area that traces back to 2024 (not shown on the chart) between 1.12007 and 1.1213, and the bounce higher is currently testing broken support turned resistance. If sellers can defend this resistance ceiling zone and push back lower through 1.1200, the next major target comes into view at the 50% retracement level near 1.1145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;771&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;772&quot; data-end=&quot;944&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;772&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;774&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance (broken support): 1.1265–1.1275&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;821&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;823&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next downside target: 1.1200 to 1.1213 (swing area from 2024)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;821&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;823&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Short-term control: Bears remain in charge below the 1.1265-75. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;946&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back above the former floor would weaken the bearish bias and open the door for a further rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
