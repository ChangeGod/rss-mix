                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices closed higher once again with the NASDAQ index leading the way with a gain of 1.61%. Today&apos;s move was fueled by the expected CPI data (0.2% for the headline and core measure versus 0.3% expected).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index is now positive on the year by 0.08%. The NASDAQ index is within -1.56% of its closing level for 2024, and now industrial average is now down -0.95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average fell -269.67 points or -0.64% at 42140.43. The Dow 30 was dragged down by UnitedHealth which tumbled -17.83% after its CEO resigned, and did not give forward guidance.. The decline took about 400 points off of the Dow itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index rose 45.36 points or 0.72% at 5886.55.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index rose 301.74 points or 1.61% at 19010.08&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 rose 10.15 points or 0.49% at 2102.34&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some big winners today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;55&quot; data-end=&quot;84&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;57&quot; data-end=&quot;84&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;First Solar – +22.63%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;123&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;87&quot; data-end=&quot;123&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Super Micro Computer – +15.99%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;124&quot; data-end=&quot;158&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;126&quot; data-end=&quot;158&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Robinhood Markets – +8.93%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;159&quot; data-end=&quot;184&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;161&quot; data-end=&quot;184&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Palantir – +8.10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;185&quot; data-end=&quot;208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;187&quot; data-end=&quot;208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rocket – +8.10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;209&quot; data-end=&quot;233&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;211&quot; data-end=&quot;233&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;ETH/USD – +7.44%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;234&quot; data-end=&quot;256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;236&quot; data-end=&quot;256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Block – +5.74%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;257&quot; data-end=&quot;280&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;259&quot; data-end=&quot;280&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NVIDIA – +5.59%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;281&quot; data-end=&quot;315&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;283&quot; data-end=&quot;315&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;American Airlines – +5.48%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;316&quot; data-end=&quot;347&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;318&quot; data-end=&quot;347&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;ARK Innovation – +5.29%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;348&quot; data-end=&quot;389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;350&quot; data-end=&quot;389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;United Airlines Holdings – +5.06%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;390&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;392&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Western Digital – +4.24%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The details were a tad on the cool side and overall CPI fell to the lowest since 2021. The moves were modest at first but steadily snowballed, adding up to a solid decline in the dollar across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in Fed pricing was more modest with the market continuing to price in a 40% chance of a cut in July and a near-certainty of a cut in September but all of those probabilities have been steadily sliding over the past three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that strong inflows to equities have been part of the reason for the recent strength in the dollar and that may be starting to ebb, though there were good buyers on ES futures dip ahead of the open and nice gains on the day (once again). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the momentum trade largely continued in stocks and oil but there were some cracks elsewhere as gold bounced and the dollar sagged. In fixed income, yields are nearing the Trump-admin high and that should start to get some attention in the days ahead, particularly as the focus shifts to the tax cut bill in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&apos;s driving Tesla&apos;s rise?</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/whats-driving-teslas-rise-20250513/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:05:05 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/whats-driving-teslas-rise-20250513/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Tesla
stock has increased&lt;/a&gt; by more than 24% in the past month.
While still far from the highs of $480 per share reached in March, investors
seem to have regained optimism, and surprisingly so. Last week, news broke that
Tesla&apos;s sales in China had declined for seven consecutive months. In addition,
new car sales in the U.K. fell 62% year-on-year in April. Why the sudden
turnaround in sentiment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason, as expected, is the renewed hope for
future improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, news broke in April that Elon Musk plans to reduce
his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to just one or two
days a week starting in May. The rest of his time, he said, will be focused on
his “business interests,” particularly Tesla. Investors have welcomed this
renewed focus on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, tensions between the United States and China have
eased slightly. The two countries recently agreed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.advfn.com/newspaper/igorkuchma/80141/are-the-trade-wars-finally-over&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;temporary
90-day tariff truce&lt;/a&gt; while they work to reach a broader
trade agreement. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese
imports from 145% to 30%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. imports from
125% to 10%. Theoretically, Tesla could benefit from the resulting drop in
tariff-related inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third catalyst is Tesla&apos;s plan to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/teslas-robotaxi-and-cybercab-trademarks-hit-roadblocks-ahead-of-june-launch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;its
autonomous driving software&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, Texas, next
June. If the RoboTaxi model is successful, it could give Tesla a technological
monopoly, resulting in significant cost savings for the cab industry. The
RoboTaxi could drive strong domestic demand before expanding to other OECD countries
because cabs are expensive in Europe and the United States. If it works, it
could be a significant value catalyst for Tesla, a key point in Ark Invest and
Cathie Wood&apos;s investment thesis. The big question now is whether Tesla can
deliver the product on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are still risks. Any delays in the
RoboTaxi rollout could hurt the stock. Further geopolitical tensions —
especially between the U.S. and the EU — could also pose a threat to Tesla’s
global operations. And while Musk may be refocusing on the company, that
doesn’t guarantee a quick rebound in vehicle demand. At the end of the day,
Tesla has always been more of a speculative play than a fundamentally grounded
one.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;144&quot; data-end=&quot;451&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD continues to grind higher after sellers failed to hold a break below key support at the 0.5825 swing area and the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart (lower green line at 0.58525). That dip yesterday and into today, quickly reversed, and buyers have regained control, driving the pair back above several key topside technical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;453&quot; data-end=&quot;535&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since then, the NZDUSD has been checking off resistance milestones, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;536&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;536&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;538&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day MA at 0.5883&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;592&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;559&quot; data-end=&quot;592&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-hour and 200-hour MAs at 0.5907 and 0.5835 respectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;593&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;595&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The current push is targeting the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, a level near 0.5949&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;690&quot; data-end=&quot;849&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum remains on the side of buyers, and a move above 0.5949 would open the door for a run toward the next major resistance zone near 0.6000 and above that the extremes for 2025 between 0.6018 and 0.6028. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;851&quot; data-end=&quot;1068&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sellers had their shot yesterday and at the start of trading today. It&apos;s the buyers turn now.  So far, the MAs have been ticked off one at at a time, but there is one more to get through at 0.59494.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1075&quot; data-end=&quot;1100&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1101&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1101&quot; data-end=&quot;1172&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1103&quot; data-end=&quot;1172&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.59494 (4H 100-bar MA), 0.6000, 0.6018 to 0.6028 (highs for the year)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1175&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5935 (swing/MA cluster), 0.5907 (100 hour MA), 0.5883 (200 day MA),0.58525 (200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1264&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: shifting back to the buyers after the sellers had their shot and missed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A day of lower-tier data head, nothing here to move major FX too much upon release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wage growth data from Australia may attract some attention. Strong wage growth can help fuel inflation, and the Reserve Bank of Australia is still not comfortable declaring a win over inflation pressure. The Bank has begun to cut its cash rate, though, and another 25bp cut is widely expected at next week&apos;s meeting (19 and 20 May). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $63.67. That is up $1.72 or 2.78%. The price is up for the fifth day in six trading days and four days in a row. Since closing at $57.15 on May 5, the price has moved up 11.38%.The close today was the highest since April 17 when the price closed at $63.68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key target comes against the 50% midpoint of the range since the April 2020 low. That level comes in at $64.71. The high intraday price from April 23 reached $61.55 – just short of that midpoint level. Swing lows going back to December 2021 stalled near that area (see yellow area on the chart below). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the rally is fueled by easing trade tensions, a recent U.S.–UK deal, and expectations for stronger demand heading into the U.S. driving season. However, gains are being capped by rising global supply, with OPEC+ accelerating the return of 2.2 million bpd in cuts and the EIA forecasting significant inventory builds throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;What happened to the Tea Party?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal conservatism continues to die a slow death in the United States and the bond market may be taking notice. The latest Congressional estimates from the  Joint Committee on Taxation show a $3.8 trillion increase in the deficit over 10 years, or about 14% of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put differently, this would add about $11,000 in debt for every American and for FY 2026, it would add $481 billion to the deficit, about 1.5 pp of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding &apos;no tax on tips&apos; and &apos;no tax on overtime&apos; until 2029. Now these estimates are just on the revenue side (though not all of it) so there are some spending cuts to come but so far Republicans are struggling to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the bond market, we&apos;re getting perilously close to 5% for 30-year yields.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;142&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is pushing higher again and now approaches a key resistance area between 1.1193 and 1.1213 — a zone that has capped rallies multiple times in the past, including three peaks in July and August 2024. The high price has reached 1.11823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;641&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding weight to the topside test is the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, currently sitting near 1.1209, right in the heart of the resistance zone. The 100-hour moving average is also in play and in that area at 1.12101 (not shown on the chart above). A clean break above this cluster would strengthen the bullish case and open the door for further upside momentum.  Conversely it could also be a level where sellers may look to lean with a stop on a break above. As such it is important for both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;643&quot; data-end=&quot;1045&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the closest support comes in at 1.11452, which previously acted as a swing high in early April and is now a short-term line in the sand for buyers. Holding above it keeps the bullish structure intact. A break below would shift the focus back toward the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally at 1.10395, and further to the 1.1000 natural support level. Yesterday the low price after the fall on the China US tariff news reached 1.1065 – well short of that 38.2% retracement target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.1193–1.1213 (swing zone), 1.1209 (200-bar MA), 1.1210 (100 hour moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1146&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.11452 (near-term swing), 1.1065 (low from yesterday, 1.10395 (38.2% retracement of move up from the January 2025 low), 1.1000 (natural support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1251&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Buyers make a play but work to do. Modest bullish bias while above 1.11452; but stronger upside if 1.1213 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While the pair may consolidate near 1.40 in the near term, BofA sees medium-term downside to 1.35 and recommends a 1-year RKO (reverse knock-out) put to express that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;433&quot; data-end=&quot;448&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;Revised Forecast: USD/CAD is now expected to end 2025 at 1.38 (previously 1.40), with potential to reach 1.35 in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;597&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;599&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;Drivers of CAD Strength: April’s rally was fueled by a BoC rate cut pause, expectations for fiscal expansion, and anticipated investment inflows—factors BofA believes may have driven temporary CAD overvaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;Near-Term Outlook: BofA sees USD/CAD trading sideways around 1.40 over the next two quarters before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;964&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;966&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;Trade Strategy: A 1-year RKO put is favored to cheaply express a bearish view while taking advantage of current skew pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1105&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1107&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;Macro Risk: The main risk is a North American recession in 2025, which would trigger renewed USD strength and invalidate the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;BofA remains moderately bearish USD/CAD into 2025, targeting 1.35 medium-term, but sees near-term consolidation.

 everything else, are DOWN!!! THE FED must lower the RATE, like Europe 
and China have done. What is wrong with Too Late Powell? Not fair to 
America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a
 beautiful thing!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market pricing is for 51 bps in easing this year, starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s no surprise the Treasury is announcing new sanctions with Trump talking about Iran and visiting the Middle East. The latest sanctions target the global network shipping Iranian oil, the Treasuy wrote in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude oil is up $1.79 to $63.74 today. The S&amp;amp;P 500 just crossed +1%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is trading to new site session highs as Pres. Trump completes his speech in Saudi Arabia. Toward the end of his speech he did say that he will order the cessation of sanctions against Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is now up 316 points or 1.69% at 19024.53. The high price came in at 19024.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday recall, the price extended above its 100-day moving average currently at 18466.65. That was the first break - and close - above  that moving average since February 24. The price also moved above a swing low from January 13 at 18831.91. Both of those levels will now be close support. Staying above is more bullish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyers are taking back more control. The next target comes against the high price from February 27 at 19286.02. Above that and were in the upper extreme which peaked at 20204.58 on December 16. That was the all-time high for the index.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD is continuing to push higher, breaking above its 100-hour moving average (blue line on the chart above) and swing level which are both at 1.3257. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum to the upside has continued to the 200-hour moving average at 1.32837. That moving average was tested on Friday&apos;s trade, but found willing sellers after a failed break above fizzled quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move above the 200-hour moving average would give the buyers more control with a high price from Friday&apos;s trade at 1.3223 the next target.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;One of the early lessons of Trump&apos;s second term is that when he says to buy stocks, the market goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s being less explicit this time and didn&apos;t write it on Truth Social so I&apos;d be cautious. Previously, he tweeted it before announcing good news like removing reciprocal tariffs and the China deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 0.8% and hasn&apos;t reacted since his comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of his other comments are on geopolitics like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest destructive force in the middle east is Iran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;404&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD has turned higher in trading today and tests the 200-day moving average, each of which failed to generate sustained upside momentum on 2 previous tests yesterday and last Thursday (despite ticks above the MA). The last two attempts above the level were particularly weak, leading to a sharper corrective move lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the pair moved lower helped by the dollar buying after the US/China tariff news, Today, the pair has reversed the declines.  The Asian and early European session saw the pair move up to test the 100 hour and the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart  (see blue lines on the chart above).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That run got another boost by the CPI data. That helped to extend above the MAs and the 200 hour MA at 0.64307.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is now testing the 200 day MA at 0.64579 (and moving higher). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Can the buyers keep the momentum going?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;937&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That will be the key for today/now.  On the topside, any rebound would need to reclaim the old highs last week including the high from May 5 at 0.6493&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;151&quot; data-end=&quot;320&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD extended higher yesterday and again earlier today, but both rallies have stalled just ahead of a key resistance confluence. The area of interest includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day moving average, currently near 1.40111&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;382&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;384&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The swing area resistance between 1.4009 and 1.4027&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;440&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;442&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s high stopped at 1.40157 before rotating back lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;506&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This zone has now rejected buyers on two separate occasions, reinforcing its role as a critical barrier that bulls must break to extend the upside bias. A clean move above 1.4027 would open the door toward the 38.2%% retracement of the move down from the March high at 1.40525, with other key resistance around the 50% and swing area between 1.4146–1.41836.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;1193&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the initial support now comes in near 1.3978, where the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart lines up with the old swing high from April 15. Holding above that level keeps the rebound and short term bullish bias intact. A move below it, however, could trigger a deeper correction down to 1.389172 1.3904 swing area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1200&quot; data-end=&quot;1225&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1228&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.4009–1.4027 (200-day MA + swing), 1.40525 (38.2% retracement), 1.4146 to 1.41836 (50% and swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1303&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3978 (4H 200-bar MA/old high from April 15), 1.38917 – 1.3904 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1390&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1392&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral to bullish above 1.3978; stronger bullish bias only above 1.4027 and then the 38.2% retracement at 1.40525&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Student loans saw large uptick in transition into delinquency rate in Q1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most other types of credit saw steady transition into delinquency rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggregate delinquency rate at 4.2% vs 3.6% in Q4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers saw household balance sheets in pretty good shape&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Credit card and auto balances both trimmed in Q1, mortgages balances rose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Household debt up 0.9% q/q&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no big surprise given that the Trump administration restarted the collection of student debt.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Details of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney&apos;s cabinet are leaking out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Francois-Philippe Champagne to be finance minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Hodgson named minister of energy and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dominic Leblanc remains in charge of US-Canada trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrystia Freeland remains minister for transport and internal trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Melanie Joly  named industry minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sean Fraser, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maninder Sidhu, Minister of International Trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evan Solomon, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are mostly familiar faces. Champagne and Leblanc travelled to Washington in March at the peak of tariff anxiety and seemed to get along with Lutnick and others at the White House so that may be a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical name will be Tim Hodgson who worked with Carney at Goldman Sachs and was CEO of Goldman Sachs Canada. He was also the Chair of Hydro One. He was recruited by Carney to run and will have a big job in developing Canadian energy and pipelines while navigating/rewriting brutal regulations. It&apos;s a strong signal that he means business on development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also notable that Carney named a minister of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market is exhibiting diverse patterns today, with notable sector-specific performance highlighting varying investor outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology Storms Ahead: The technology sector is experiencing substantial growth. Nvidia (NVDA) is a major highlight, surging by 5.00%, driven by robust performance expectations and increased demand for AI technologies. Oracle (ORCL) and Palantir (PLTR) also see significant gains, up 2.13% and 4.33%, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical Resilience: The consumer cyclical arena is buoyant, with Amazon (AMZN) climbing 2.81%. Tesla (TSLA) also rejoices with a rise of 1.24%, reflecting positive market sentiment towards these retail and automotive giants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Sector Under Pressure: Conversely, the healthcare sector suffers, with UnitedHealth (UNH) nosediving 14.80%, dragging down overall sentiment. Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) also face declines of 0.43% and 3.73%, respectively, possibly due to unfavorable earnings reports or regulatory challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Services Ascend: The sector, guided by Google (GOOG) up 1.00%, showcases a robust outlook, supported by positive investor confidence in digital advertising prospects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s trading landscape paints a picture of mixed sentiment. Investors are clearly favoring tech and consumer cyclical stocks, likely due to optimism surrounding emerging technologies and consumer spending potential. However, the pronounced downturn in the healthcare sector suggests caution, perhaps due to policy discussions or earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering today’s performance, investors are encouraged to monitor the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capitalize on Technology: Given the upbeat trajectory in tech, maintaining or increasing exposure to key players like Nvidia and Oracle could capitalize on ongoing trends. Pay close attention to innovations and earnings announcements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review Healthcare Holdings: With current uncertainties, reconsideration of holdings in the healthcare sector is advisable. Keep an eye on regulatory changes and future earnings guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification Remains Key: Well-balanced portfolios across resilient sectors, including communication services and stable consumer cyclical stocks, can mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay informed with real-time updates and comprehensive analyses at ForexLive.com to adeptly navigate the market&apos;s evolving dynamics. 📈&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDCHF finds buyers at key swing floor after rally stalls short of retracement target</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;159&quot; data-end=&quot;398&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF moved higher yesterday on the back of broad USD strength, but momentum stalled before reaching the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.84823. The high price reached 0.8475.  That retracement level remains a critical hurdle for any sustained recovery.  Absent that, and the correction higher is just a plain-vanilla variety and keeps the sellers in play.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;400&quot; data-end=&quot;686&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, price action has rotated lower but found support at a well-defined swing area between 0.8368 and 0.84087 — a zone that has served as a floor going back to August 2024. Buyers stepped in as the pair tested the lower end of that support band during the European/early US session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also helping to reinforce the support is the falling 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near the swing low. That technical confluence is attracting dip buyers, at least for now. The current price is above the swing area high at 0.84087.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support holding on the dip has set the stage for the battle between the buyers down to 0.8369 and the sellers up to 0.84823.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;901&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In summary, bulls will need to see a break above 0.84823 (38.2% retracement) to tilt the bias more favorably to the upside. On the downside, a break back below 0.8368 would open the door toward deeper targets and shift the bias firmly back to bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1192&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1195&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8368–0.84087 (swing area), 0.8318 to 0.8340 (swing area), 0.82723 (low from late April)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1285&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.84823 (38.2% retrace), 0.85309 to 0.85573 (swing), 0.86193 (50% retrace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1367&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral above 0.8368; bullish above 0.84823; bearish below 0.8368&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fear has been replaced by FOMO in markets. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now up 40 points and getting to within striking distance of 6000, which we haven&apos;t been above since March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market continues to digest the US-China trade war climb down and it likes what it&apos;s hearing. We are expecting comments from Trump shortly so that could be a source of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zooming out to the daily chart, there isn&apos;t much standing in the way of a return to the February all-time highs now.&lt;/p&gt;
