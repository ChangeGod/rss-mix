      <title>PBOC is expected to set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.2133 – Reuters estimate</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The airport has been beset by issues that haverve raised safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the US Federal Aviation Administration statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAA issued an interim order reducing the flight arrival and departure rate at Newark Liberty International Airport.Under the interim order issued Tuesday, the maximum hourly rate will be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;28 arrivals and 28 departures until construction of Runway 4-Left/22-Right is complete. Daily construction will end on June 15, 2025, but will continue on Saturdays until the end of the year. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outside of the construction period, 34 arrivals and departures until Oct. 25, 2025. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,” said Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau.The new limits take effect on May 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there folks!&lt;/p&gt;

Early on, we saw CAD jump as core CPI numbers were hotter than expected. That led to BOC June rate cut odds falling to 35% from 65% and USD/CAD to fall 34 pips to 1.3914, edging below a series of lows this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar started the session out strong as yields rose but was steadily sold as the day continued. The pound sagged to a session low early in New York trade but rallied 50 pips from there to 1.3386 to finish near the European high. The euro finished at the best level of the day and just shy of Monday&apos;s peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUD/USD was pressured after the RBA cut and said it considered a 50 bps cut but after some heavy selling in Asia and early Europe the Aussie found a bottom and bounced by 30 pips as the US dollar sagged broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsflow was light but the bond market may have seen some selling after Trump leaned on Congressional Republicans to pass the tax cut bill without any fresh cost cuts. The House is expected to vote in the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Second flagship fund closed above the original hard cap with strong support from existing investors and new investors comprising more than two-thirds of capital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● 83% of completed investments have been sourced with in-house developed AI platform, DIANE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● Invictus empowers previously bootstrapped cloud software, cybersecurity, and fintech companies with dedicated operating and data science resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Invictus Growth Partners (“Invictus”), a leading private equity firm focused on growth buyouts of lower middle-market enterprise software businesses in the cloud software, cybersecurity, and fintech sectors, announced the final closing of Invictus Growth Fund II, L.P. (“Fund II”), with total capital commitments of $574 million in its core fund and related co-investment funds. Fund II was oversubscribed at $488 million in fund commitments, surpassing both its target of $350 million and the original hard cap of $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&quot;We are honored and grateful for the support from our returning and new investors, which include pension plans, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, healthcare institutions, and family offices,” said John DeLoche, Invictus Co-founder and Managing Partner. “The early support and leadership from our existing investors helped to drive investor demand and facilitate a successful fundraise despite a challenging environment.” “We will continue our strategy of bringing a partnership approach and deep operating expertise and resources to our portfolio companies to help them scale,” said William Nettles, Invictus Co-founder and Managing Partner. “This includes our world class team’s stewardship, machine learning-powered GTM operational enhancements through our DIANE platform, and the support of a dedicated portfolio company success team, the Invictus Guild.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Invictus&apos; Fund II received strong support from existing investors, and new investors made up more than two thirds of total committed capital, broadening the diversification of the firm’s world class institutional limited partner base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Invictus has completed twelve platform investments and add-on acquisitions in its focus areas of enterprise cloud software, cybersecurity, and fintech. The firm targets companies with at least $10 million of annual recurring revenue that have been bootstrapped or have annual recurring revenue greater than equity capital raised. Invictus targets companies with strong product market fit that are profitable or nearly profitable at the time of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ten of the twelve completed investments were sourced with DIANE, Invictus’ proprietary machine learning-powered outbound sales engine for B2B use cases. DIANE is an acronym for Deal Intelligence Assessment Neural Engine, and was built in-house at Invictus starting in 2019. Invictus is now on its third generation of machine learning for operational enhancements powered by DIANE. The first generation focused on in-house investment sourcing. The second and third generations focus on GTM operational enhancements which are exclusively available to Invictus portfolio companies. Portfolio companies have seen a 90% increase in direct sales efficiency leveraging the platform, which also provides access to thousands of potential new enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Portfolio companies also benefit from access to the Invictus Guild, a team of operating executives who have experience working at some of the most successful technology companies. Invictus Guild Members operate across ten disciplines that are crucial for scaling technology companies, including sales, marketing, customer success, business development, corporate development, data science, human resources, product development, finance, and CEO coaches. They serve as mentors, operational advisors, and sources of best practices and talent for Invictus portfolio companies. They also invest personally in every portfolio company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Zaid Abdul-Aleem, Invictus Partner and Head of Partner and Capital Solutions, led the Fund II fundraise while Cooley served as Legal Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;About Invictus Growth Partners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Invictus Growth Partners (https://www.invictusgrowth.com/) is a buyout and growth equity firm that invests in outstanding, bootstrapped, capital-efficient, automation-enabled cloud software, cybersecurity, and fintech companies. The firm is dedicated to supporting companies seeking capital and strategic resources to accelerate their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;118&quot; data-end=&quot;446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD has made a technical push higher in today’s session, breaking above both the key swing area between 1.12657 and 1.12754, and the 38.2% retracement of the April–May decline at 1.12754. That dual-level break gives buyers added control in the short term and confirms momentum shifting back in favor of the bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;448&quot; data-end=&quot;747&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s high stalled just above this zone at 1.12876, and that level now becomes the next key upside target. A move above it would further solidify the bullish bias and open the path toward the 50% retracement level near 1.1318 and the falling trend line resistance closer to 1.1345.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;749&quot; data-end=&quot;1005&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, support is now layered. The 1.1265–1.1275 area, now broken, becomes the first line of defense. Below that, the broken 38.2% at 1.12585. Below that, and the buyers are likely disappointed on the failed break with focus returning back to the 100-hour MA at 1.1210, with the 200-hour MA at 1.11989.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The price of June crude oil futures are settling down -$0.13 or -0.21% at $62.56. The high price reached $63.17. The low price was at $62.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the hourly chart, the price on Monday moved back above its 100-hour moving average (the blue line on the chart above), and for most of the trading day, support buyers have been showing up against that moving average line – keeping the buyers in control from a technical perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, it would take a move back below the 100-hour moving average and 200-hour moving average currently at $61.82, to increase the bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP TO APPOINT GEN. GUETLEIN TO LEAD $831B &apos;GOLDEN DOME&apos; MISSILE SHIELD

President Trump plans to name Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein to lead the &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; a new missile defense system aimed at protecting the U.S. from advanced threats like hypersonic weapons and low-flying missiles. The system would blend existing interceptors with satellite-based defenses.

The project could cost up to $831 billion over 20 years, with $25 billion proposed in the next budget. Guetlein, a space and missile defense expert, has warned of growing threats from China and backs increased U.S. space investments.

Trump is pushing for a fast rollout, prioritizing components that can be completed during his term. The &quot;Golden Dome&quot; will combine traditional and emerging defense technologies.</title>
