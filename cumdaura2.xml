                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market heatmap today reveals a dynamic landscape of performance across various sectors. While the technology sector struggled to find footing, the financials surged ahead, providing a significant anchor for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📉 Technology Sector: Notable tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Oracle (ORCL) faced challenges, slipping by 0.93% and 1.37% respectively. The overall sentiment in technology seemed cautious, partly due to continued pressure on semiconductors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📈 Financial Sector: This sector shone brightly today, with financial heavyweights such as Visa (V) and BlackRock (BLK) posting gains of 1.41% and 1.10% respectively. Investor confidence appears to be buoyed by optimism surrounding interest rate trends and economic recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🔺 Consumer Defensive Sector: Companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and Walmart (WMT) had varied performances, with KO enjoying a 2.02% rise, suggesting strong consumer staples support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🔻 Consumer Cyclical Sector: Interestingly, the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) saw declines of 2.89% and 2.84% respectively, indicating investor hesitation in the cyclical domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market&apos;s mood reflected a mixed bag of emotions today. While technology grappled with uncertainties, financials boosted overall market morale. The shifting dynamics likely stem from the latest financial earnings releases and macroeconomic updates, with investors keeping a keen eye on inflationary pressures and the Fed&apos;s next moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the current sector analysis and trend evaluation, it is advisable for investors to consider a diversified approach. Focusing on financially robust sectors like the Financials can offer stability while awaiting clearer signals from the technology sector, which remains a challenge amidst semiconductor struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market navigates through these fluctuating dynamics, consider re-evaluating positions in high-beta sectors and focusing on defensive plays like consumer staples.

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;86&quot; data-end=&quot;361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD continues to face strong resistance at the 200-day moving average, which capped rallies both on Monday and again today at the session high of 0.6457. Sellers leaned into that level, keeping upside momentum in check and maintaining the bearish pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;363&quot; data-end=&quot;537&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, a cluster of moving averages, all broken on the move lower, sits between 0.6419 and 0.6437 and now acts as a key resistance zone. This area includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;538&quot; data-end=&quot;660&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;538&quot; data-end=&quot;572&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;540&quot; data-end=&quot;572&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-hour MA at 0.64376&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;573&quot; data-end=&quot;607&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;575&quot; data-end=&quot;607&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-hour MA at 0.64254&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;608&quot; data-end=&quot;660&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;610&quot; data-end=&quot;660&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.6419&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;662&quot; data-end=&quot;927&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the fall, the low price reached 0.6401, just above the psychological 0.6400 level, where support buyers emerged. However, the rebound stalled at 0.6422, unable to reclaim the broken MAs—giving sellers a short-term advantage below this cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;929&quot; data-end=&quot;1137&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;To shift the bias back to the upside, the pair needs to sustain a move above 0.6437, and then break through the 200-day MA at 0.6457. That would open the door toward 0.6513, the high for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1139&quot; data-end=&quot;1350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, a break below 0.6400 could see further downside toward the next support at 0.6388, followed by the broader swing area between 0.6321 and 0.63437. Beyond that, key support targets include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1351&quot; data-end=&quot;1444&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1351&quot; data-end=&quot;1384&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1353&quot; data-end=&quot;1384&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-day MA at 0.62951&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1385&quot; data-end=&quot;1444&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1387&quot; data-end=&quot;1444&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 38.2% retracement of the April rally at 0.62844&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The toughest negotiation of all for the US administration is with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don&apos;t see any world where the EU can accept a 10% floor on tariffs. But there is also a significant trade surplus with the US so I don&apos;t see how Trump&apos;s team can back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the EU gets sub-10% tariffs then what about other trade partners? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world maybe all tariffs end up back at zero and the US gets some trade concessions that open up some markets. There&apos;s a decent chance of that but that sort of &apos;win&apos; is hardly worth the political cost the US has already paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

 The harmful effects of tariffs are likely to become evident in the U.S., Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco says in a note. Recent data releases do not fully reflect the impact of tariffs, he says. &quot;There is evidence that U.S. consumers are pulling spending forward, and that companies have been stockpiling before the tariffs hit,&quot; he says. The full impact &quot;will start to emerge&quot; in due course, he says.</title>

That is still TBD but it seems that at a minimum, tariffs will rise by 10%. What does that do to prices, demand, and inventories?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today, financial markets no longer dance
solely to the rhythm of macroeconomic data releases. Instead, they often lurch
or rally in response to an offhand remark from a political leader or an abrupt
policy tweet. Nowhere is this more evident than in recent weeks, where
headlines—not spreadsheets—have dominated market momentum. Traditional
indicators like inflation figures or Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) still
carry weight, but traders should also read between the headlines and act on the
fly. Octa Broker provides examples of how news affects the market and what
events are worth monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Historical
Impact of News on Markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-shocking news is nothing new. Arguably,
one of the most infamous examples occurred on 15 January 2015, when the Swiss
National Bank unexpectedly eliminated its currency ceiling against the euro.
Within seconds, the EUR/CHF pair &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30829917&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;plummeted
by nearly 30%&lt;/a&gt;, wiping billions from the forex markets and sending
shockwaves around global financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This historical context matters. It
reminds that both scheduled and unscheduled news can have outsized impacts on
market pricing, especially when market participants are caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled vs.
Unscheduled News Events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled news events, by their nature,
offer predictability. Reports such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), labour
market data, PMIs, and central bank meetings are calendar fixtures. Their
importance, however, varies depending on the issuing country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is a leader in terms of
influence. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, U.S. economic data has
global ramifications. An example is the U.S. CPI reading, which not only shifts
USD pairs but, often, equity indexes and commodities. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics releases these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/schedule/2025/05_sched.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;
monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Release/ReleaseDates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;PMI reports&lt;/a&gt;, often early indicators of
economic health, are published by S&amp;amp;P Global on a harmonised schedule
across major economies. Central bank meeting dates, while known in advance,
still generate high volatility due to surprise rate decisions or hawkish/dovish
commentary. Federal Reserve (Fed) meetings can be tracked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the European Central Bank’s (ECB)
schedule is also available on the institution’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/calendars/mgcgc/html/index.en.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, unscheduled news events are
unpredictable and often far more dramatic in terms of market impact. These
include geopolitical tensions, unexpected policy announcements, or political
rhetoric. On 1 February 2025, President Trump&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-readies-order-steep-tariffs-goods-mexico-canada-china-2025-02-01&quot;&gt;sudden announcement&lt;/a&gt; of comprehensive tariffs
on Canadian imports pushed USD/CAD to record multi-decade highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surge of
Unscheduled News in Recent Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 2025 exemplified how chaotic
unscheduled news can become.  In early
April, shifting U.S. tariff policies caused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/stock-market-recovery-trump-tariffs.html&quot;&gt;sharp moves in equity markets&lt;/a&gt;. Major indices
dropped into correction territory but later recovered after revised statements.
Then, in early May, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/us-job-growth-slows-marginally-april-unemployment-rate-steady-42-2025-05-02&quot;&gt;mixed job data&lt;/a&gt; added to the uncertainty,
offering little clarity on what to expect next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current News
Events Influencing the Markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several unscheduled narratives are
currently steering sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Trade negotiations between the
U.S. and China are ongoing, with some progress achieved, but uncertainty
continues to linger as to whether an acceptable and long-lasting agreement can
be achieved within a 90-day deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
President Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-wont-remove-fed-chair-powell-before-term-ends-2026-tv-interview-2025-05-04&quot;&gt;public critique&lt;/a&gt; of Fed Chair Jerome Powell
continues to inject uncertainty into the monetary policy outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Meanwhile, the U.S. remains
involved—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/02/us-will-not-fly-around-the-world-to-mediate-ukraine-russia-meetings-washington-says&quot;&gt;albeit hesitantly&lt;/a&gt;—in peace talks between
Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Trade discussions with Japan have
also become strained, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/us-cedes-little-ground-key-tariffs-talks-with-japan-nikkei-says-2025-05-02&quot;&gt;little progress &lt;/a&gt;reported thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategies for
Traders During High-Volatility News Cycles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this news-saturated environment,
adaptability is key. Traders can navigate volatility with the following
strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Use smaller position sizes to
limit exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Apply tighter stop-loss orders to
protect against sudden swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Opt for short-term trades to
reduce the risk of overnight event surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Avoid overly volatile assets
unless accompanied by clear signals or hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at
Octa Broker, notes: ‘With news-driven and
unexpected volatilities driving trading in our current setting, traders must
become more reactive and less anticipatory in their strategies. Do not try to
front-run and second-guess the outcome of this or that event. Instead, wait for
the dust to settle and then enter the market. Position sizing should reflect
the current volatility regime, ideally calculated through dynamic risk metrics
like ATR (Average True Range). Most importantly, traders should maintain a
structured news-monitoring routine and understand the second-order effects of
headlines—for example, how a tariff announcement may ripple through
commodities, currencies, and interest rate expectations simultaneously.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Octa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled economic releases still matter,
but unscheduled news—particularly in the current politically charged global
climate—has emerged as the primary driver of market sentiment. The line between
economic and political news continues to blur, and with it, the predictability
of price action. For traders, this means one thing above all: stay flexible,
stay informed, and adjust strategies to match the new reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance
reminder: trading
Contracts for Difference (CFDs) carries a high level of risk and may not be
suitable for all investors. Emotional trading can increase this risk. Always
trade within your means and understand the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.octafx.com?utm_source=media&amp;amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_campaign=%20How_to_Trade_During_NewsDriven_Volatility&amp;amp;utm_content=ww_fx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Octa &lt;/a&gt;is an international broker that has been providing online

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;409&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD moved back above the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart (currently at 1.3957) yeasteray, and found support against it during today’s pullback. That level now serves as immediate support, and holding above it keeps the near-term bullish bias intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;411&quot; data-end=&quot;655&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, the 200-day moving average at 1.40126 remains a key upside target, reinforced by a swing area resistance between 1.40097 and 1.40268. Earlier this week, the high price stalled within this zone, just above the 200-day MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;657&quot; data-end=&quot;855&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above that resistance area would open the door toward the 38.2% retracement of the March decline at 1.40525, which is the next critical hurdle for buyers aiming to regain firmer control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;857&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, a move back below 1.3957 could trigger a rotation toward the next key support swing area between 1.38917 and 1.3904, which held the low yesterday and earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;857&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The battle is on between the dip buyers and the rally sellers.  Traders wait for the next break. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1069&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1070&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1070&quot; data-end=&quot;1141&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1072&quot; data-end=&quot;1141&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3957 (200-bar MA on H4), 1.38917–1.3904 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1142&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.40126 (200-day MA), 1.40097–1.40268 (swing area), 1.40525 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s US retail sales report was mostly positive news. The control group was the lone exception but that was on softer grocery store spending while economically-sensitive spots showed some real strength, like food services and drinking places up 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFO of the world&apos;s biggest retailer had this to say on the call today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; February was softer than expected, March was back to normal and April was very strong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the report there were some signs of consumers stretching dollars toward essentials and value. Comp sales rose 4.5% though with transactions up 1.6%. Again, much of that was in groceries and essentials as general merchandise slipped slightly but it&apos;s not a big red flag. Some could be higher end consumers trading down but you really have to squint to see a soft consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internationally, they also saw steady but slower spending in Mexico and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign came from Comcast today, which owns theme parks in the US and around the world. At a conference, the company CFO said there has been no sign of impact from economic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of WMT are down 2.3% pre-market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;64&quot; data-end=&quot;324&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to find sellers near familiar technical levels, with the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.8482 acting as firm resistance earlier this week. The inability to push above that level has resulted in a retracement lower as sellers remain in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;326&quot; data-end=&quot;382&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The swing area halted yesterday&apos;s fall between 0.8318 and 0.8333 (the low reached 0.83233), which previously served as resistance and now acts as support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;554&quot; data-end=&quot;754&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers will want to see price remain above that 0.8318–0.8333 zone to maintain short-term bullish hopes. A move below would weaken the technical picture and open the door for further downside probing. Also in play above that is the falling 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.8342 (see green line on the chart above). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;954&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, the 38.2% retracement at 0.8482 remains the key level to break to shift control more decisively to the buyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;956&quot; data-end=&quot;971&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;972&quot; data-end=&quot;1097&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;972&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;974&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8344 (200-bar MA on 4-hour chart), 0.8318–0.8333 (key swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1035&quot; data-end=&quot;1097&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1037&quot; data-end=&quot;1097&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8473. (This is the high of swing area going back January 2015 - not shown), 0.8482 (38.2% Fib of move down from 2025 high), 0.8619 (50% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Oil prices sank today after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/more-on-iran-is-ready-to-sign-a-nuclear-deal-if-sanctions-lifted-20250514/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;said Iran is ready to sign a nuclear deal if all economic sanctions are lifted. Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-were-getting-close-to-doing-a-deal-with-iran-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;added &lt;/a&gt;to that by saying Iran had agreed to terms and that &quot;we&apos;re getting close to doing a deal with Iran.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pushes back on that a bit but there is some serious smoke around a deal. Oil prices have come about $1 off the bottom but that was before this headline.&lt;/p&gt;

That spike was reversed last week. The details for each state was released today and lo and behold New York fell by -15K.&lt;/p&gt;

Intermediate goods inputs also fell 2.0% and construction prices were down 0.4% m/m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough to look at this and see anything but disinflation in the pipeline. If not for the trade war, the Fed would be signaling a cut in June.&lt;/p&gt;

I would expect even more improvement in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-months forward index jumped from 6.9 to 47.2 and the new orders one from 6.6 to 49.7. This just shows that we could really get a covid-like bullwhip scenario where we see a surge in demand and economic activity after the April&apos;s rout.&lt;/p&gt;

I wouldn&apos;t read too much into it though as it came after a strong month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some notable parts of the report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food services and drinking places +0.8% (there is high consumer sensitivity here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clothing +0.9% (tariff front running?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building materials and garden +0.9% (good sign on housing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Furniture and home furnishings +1.4% (again, good for housing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicles +0.9% (tariff frontrunning?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grocery stores +0.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real weakness here is in grocery stores so overall I&apos;d say this report is a strong endorsement of the health of the consumer even after the tariff war kicked off. Some of that could be tariff front-running so we&apos;ll see if it holds up but it&apos;s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report notes that although the US is considering to revise the agreement, the Japanese camp is not anticipating such a change. As such, there is a possibility that negotiations will meet a deadlock. The revision to the agreement seems to be centered around the possibility of the US requesting further concessions on agriculture and livestock products, according to the sources. And that is something that Japan has refused to budge from the initial discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, we&apos;ll just have to wait and see. But at least there&apos;s a possible timeline to look out for. Japan&apos;s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, could be travelling to Washington as soon as next week for a third round of trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The takeaway from the earnings call today comes from these remarks by Doug McMillon. He warned that Walmart is planning to raise prices on some items as Trump&apos;s tariffs are weighing on the firm&apos;s costing. And that these price hikes will begin later this month, despite the recent temporary reprieve between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If even Walmart has to be one to raise prices, you can surely expect smaller firms to also do so. That especially as it is going to be a messy logistical summer in sorting out supply chains. From before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/tariffs-policy-can-change-overnight-but-supply-chains-cannot-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Tariffs policy can change overnight but supply chains cannot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Adding to McMillon&apos;s remarks, Walmart finance chief, John David Rainey, also said that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;ll see how this all plays out in the months ahead. But if you&apos;re in the Fed&apos;s position, it continues to reaffirm that the wait-and-see approach remains the most prudent stance at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, all of this is outdated data as we haven&apos;t seen the impact of tariffs yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, we got some tidbits on trade but nothing that really stands out. The EU and US only look to set up a meeting in three weeks&apos; time while Trump touted a proposal by India on zero tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar remained more sluggish throughout though, continuing with the mood from yesterday. EUR/USD pushed up to a high of 1.1228 before keeping around 1.1187 currently - still up 0.1% on the day. Meanwhile, USD/JPY is continuing to track lower as it tests waters below the 146.00 mark. The low earlier touched 145.48 before keeping near the figure level again now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is holding more modest against the commodity currencies though. USD/CAD is flattish around 1.3985 while AUD/USD is down 0.3% to 0.6405 on the day. For the aussie, it&apos;s a bit of a setback after the better jobs report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-april-2025-unemployment-rate-41-vs-41-expected-employment-change-890k-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, equities are keeping more sluggish today as the upside momentum begins to run into a bit exhaustion. European indices are mostly down again, though losses are relatively light. Meanwhile, S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.4% and that comes even with Walmart earnings turning out for the better but there is a word of warning about prices there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, the bond market continues to offer something of interest with yields staying on the higher side. We&apos;re not quite breaching 5% yet on 30-year yields but it is still keeping thereabouts on the week, now seen at 4.95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Up next, we&apos;ll have a slew of US data to work through with PPI, retail sales, and the weekly jobless claims on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GBPUSD poised for another rally or first we get a deeper pullback?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD got a boost across
the board on Monday as the US-China tariff relief was a much better than
expected news. The market started to look at the more hawkish scenario where we
get an average 10% global tariff rate and economic activity picks up on an
easing in growth fears and general uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led to a hawkish
repricing in interest rates expectations with the market now seeing 50 bps of
easing for the Fed by year-end compared to like 120 bps at the peak of the
fears in April. The short dollar trade was pretty overcrowded so the unwinding
in positioning gave the greenback even more strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we repriced the interest
rates expectations, the USD started to lose ground against the major currencies
once again. We will likely need the market to price in an even less dovish path
for interest rates to give the greenback another boost. That could come from
economic data or hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the GBP side, there wasn&apos;t much change in the fundamentals but the hawks are starting to get uncomfortable by the lack of meaningful progress on inflation, especially on the wage growth side. The market is pricing in 45 bps of easing by year end, which is roughly equal to two rate cuts every quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that GBPUSD threatened a break below the key 1.32 handle on Monday, but eventually rallied back above it erasing the USD gains. If we get back to that level, we can expect the buyers to step in once again with a defined risk below it to position for a rally into new cycle highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the major upward trendline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that we have a downward trendline defining the bearish structure on this timeframe. This consolidation has also formed what looks like a bullish flag but we will need a break above the trendline to confirm that. For now, the sellers will likely continue to lean on the downward trendline to push into new lows, while the buyers will wait for a break higher to increase the bullish bets into new cycle highs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No preparations for a Putin visit in the coming days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing has been agreed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do not know yet how negotiations will go (when asked if Putin will go if Trump does)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too early to talk about what will happen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do not even know if Ukraine will show up or how talks will pan out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Putin&apos;s no-show has pretty much thrown things into disarray here. On the Ukrainian side, they&apos;re displeased that Putin is sending a more &quot;low-level&quot; delegation. It sort of undermines the intention and motivation. Well, so much for the early week drama. And so the battle rages on..&lt;/p&gt;
