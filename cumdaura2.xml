                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;167&quot; data-end=&quot;465&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is trading above its 200-hour moving average (currently at 1.1347) for the third consecutive day. In the previous two attempts, the pair posted modest gains before retreating, so a sustained move above this level would be a more convincing bullish signal from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;467&quot; data-end=&quot;682&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the pair fails to hold above the 200-hour MA, focus shifts back to the 100-hour moving average at 1.13296. Conservative traders may use a break below this level as confirmation that upside momentum has faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;735&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, key resistance levels to watch are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;736&quot; data-end=&quot;796&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;736&quot; data-end=&quot;767&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;738&quot; data-end=&quot;767&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1364 – Yesterday’s high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;768&quot; data-end=&quot;796&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;770&quot; data-end=&quot;796&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1380 – Friday’s high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;798&quot; data-end=&quot;896&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above these levels would strengthen the bullish bias and open the door for further upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;798&quot; data-end=&quot;896&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is the third time a charm? Will the buyers make a more concerted effort and move higher, or is this just another failed break with focus still on the downside (at least in the short term)?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Oil has closed the opening gap for the week and is now up $2.01 to $59.13. It&apos;s an unlikely rebound after OPEC+ added barrels once again on the weekend and a leak said they will continue to do so until Kazakhstan and Iraq meet their pledges to pay back overproduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is an element of short-covering at the moment but yesterday&apos;s report from shale driller Diamondback Energy highlights the likelihood of US output falling this year (and continuing to fall sub-$60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company cut its capex budget for the year by 10% and CEO Travis Stice penned a letter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are taking our foot off the accelerator as we approach a red light. 
If the light turns green before we get to the stoplight, we will hit the
 gas again, but we are also prepared to brake if needed,&quot; Stice wrote, highlighting that it needs to see $65 oil, particularly with steel tariffs spiking the price of casing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimates the US frac crew count is down 15% this year and expected to decline further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is likely that US onshore production has peaked,&quot; he said in a sharp rebuke to &apos;drill, baby, drill&apos; talk of the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big kicker is that US Tier 1 inventory is drying up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, geologic headwinds outweigh the tailwinds provided by improvements in technology and operational efficiency,&quot; Stice wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At oil below $70, those headwinds won&apos;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;179&quot; data-end=&quot;437&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD continues to grind lower, posting a series of lower lows over the last 13 days, but downside momentum remains limited. The pair has been largely contained within a broad consolidation range, with the lower boundary near 1.3759 and resistance capped near 1.3904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;439&quot; data-end=&quot;746&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;More recent attempts by buyers to push the price above the 200-hour moving average (green line currently near 1.38346) have failed, reinforcing that moving average—as well as the nearby 100-hour MA at 1.38148—as interim resistance. The inability to break these levels over the last few days, signals that buyers are still lacking conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;748&quot; data-end=&quot;960&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overhead (on a break of the 200-hour MA), a firm ceiling between 1.3892 and 1.3904 has rejected rallies multiple times over the past few weeks. A break above that zone would be needed to shift the medium-term bias more favorably for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;962&quot; data-end=&quot;1154&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, while the pair has marked incremental new lows, momentum has been shallow. Support remains near 1.3759, and a break below could open up further downside probing as the pair trades at the lowest level going back to October 2024. The 61.8% of the range since the September 2024 low closing at 1.37415. Getting below that retracement level would be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1186&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1189&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.38148 (100-hour MA), 1.38346 (200-hour MA), 1.3892–1.3904 (swing area forming ceiling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1263&quot; data-end=&quot;1292&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1265&quot; data-end=&quot;1292&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3759 - 1.3781 (lows going back to April 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1293&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1295&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish tilt while below moving averages, but lacking strong downside momentum until a break and staying below 2024 lows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

These levels are acting as short-term resistance. A sustained move above would tilt the bias modestly higher and expose the top of the consolidation zone near 0.8333. Beyond that, the 38.2% retracement of the move down from the March 31 high comes in at 0.83505&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;807&quot; data-end=&quot;989&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, failure to hold above the moving averages could see the pair rotate back toward the lower bound of the range near 0.8195, with further support around a swing area between 0.8097 and 0.81288 of the low price from 2024 and 0.80389. That is also the low price going back to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;996&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1024&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8259 (100/200-hour MAs), 0.8318 to 0.8333 (swing high area of the consolidation range)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1089&quot; data-end=&quot;1130&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1130&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8195 to 0.8212 (swing area at the low of the red box)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1131&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1133&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Modest negative below the 100/200 hour moving averages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;162&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD is showing signs of bullish revival after holding firm against a key support zone. Over the past several trading days, the pair repeatedly tested the 1.3259–1.32735 region (marked with red numbered circles on the chart) and held, forming a solid floor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s price action shows a decisive rebound above the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart (blue line, currently at 1.3303)  The break above these levels adds to bullish sentiment and shifts the near-term bias to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;778&quot; data-end=&quot;1031&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next key hurdle was then broken at the resistance swing area between 1.3362 and 1.3378. With the break, it opens the door for a retest of the year’s high at 1.3441. The 2024 high from September was just below that level at 1.3433.  Earlier highs from Arpil reached up to 1.3423 making the 1.3423 to 1.34413 a key area to get to and through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1033&quot; data-end=&quot;1057&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support now comes in at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1084&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1060&quot; data-end=&quot;1084&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3361 (low of swing area just broken. )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1085&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1087&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3303 (100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1112&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1114&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3259–1.3274 (tested four times and held forming a floor over the last week or so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1162&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back below the 1.3259 level would invalidate the bullish bias and target the next downside swing zone near 1.3201, with further support at 1.3160 (38.2% retracement of the April move).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;When Trump was elected, one of the most-predictable outcomes was a resumption of steel and aluminum tariffs. This chart shows imports of &apos;finished metal shapes&apos;, which is the official way of saying &apos;things made out of metal&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That points to a $78 billion excess build-up in US metals imports that will slowly be exhausted. How slowly? At the pre-2025 pace of imports of pre-tariffs of $3.48 billion, it will take 22 months to exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;

India Prime Minister Modi said they have successfully concluded a mutually beneficial trade agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Crude Oil Futures Analysis for Today: Sellers Taking Control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearish Momentum IntensifiesCrude oil futures are showing increased bearish momentum today after clear rejection at yesterday&apos;s Value Area High (VAH) of 58.86. Order flow data indicates significant weakening of buyer strength and increasing seller pressure, particularly noted by negative delta shifts in recent trading sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Technical Insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejection at 58.86 Resistance: Sellers have successfully defended this crucial resistance, signaling potential bearish continuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Order Flow Weakness: Buyer activity has noticeably faded, confirmed by declining buy volume and negative delta percentages, suggesting institutional selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential Downside Targets for Short Sellers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Target:57.57 – Immediate support zone, potential partial profit-taking area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Target:57.19 – Key intraday pivot, further selling could accelerate upon breaking this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Target:56.91 – Volume-based support, possible short-term reversal or consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Target:56.69 – Lower boundary of recent trading range, major target for shorts if bearish momentum persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trader Guidance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor price behavior closely around these outlined targets. Confirmation of continued bearish order flow, such as sustained negative delta and increasing sell volume, would validate the potential for deeper moves lower. Conversely, a sharp reversal or strong buying absorption at any of these levels would signal caution for short positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade at your own risk and ensure disciplined risk management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Where are the US red lines on trade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the big question that needs an answer for me to have any kind of conviction in the macro outlook. Yesterday Kyodo &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/05/7f50bb4801c0-update1-us-rejects-japans-exemption-from-reciprocal-tariffs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Japan&apos;s 
top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa in their meeting in Washington last week 
that the administration of President Donald Trump intends to put only a 
cut in the 14 percent country-specific tariff, suspended through early 
July, on the negotiating table, the sources said&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a big problem for Japan and the rest of the world. If the US is putting a floor on 10% tariffs then we&apos;re in for a bruising trade war. I just can&apos;t see many countries conceding anything if the US isn&apos;t aiming for free trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I fear that Trump wants these negotiations to fail so he can put on tariffs. Maybe that sets up a showdown with Congress that restores order but that&apos;s a hard bet to make at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we get US and Canadian trade balance numbers today for March. At 11:30 pm ET, Carney will arrive to meet Trump and the pair will have a meeting 15 minutes later and then lunch at 12:15 pm ET. It&apos;s not clear when they will address the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the trade data, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to be a market mover.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is moving lower vs. the major currencies. The FOMC rate decision is still one day away where they market traders will be interested in what the Fed has to say about future policy action. For today what technical levels are being broken from the USD selling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD:
Sellers emerged early in the Asian session, but once again, buyers stepped in near 1.1273—a key support level on the daily chart. The repeated defense of this level pushed the pair higher, but gains stalled near the 200-hour moving average at 1.13469. That moving average has capped rallies over the past two days, each time leading to a reversal. Today, sellers appear more cautious. A sustained move above the 200-hour moving average would shift the technical bias more firmly to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY:
Last Friday, USDJPY tested the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, where sellers stepped in and drove the pair lower. In today’s session, the price first broke below the 200-hour moving average and then found temporary support at the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart near 142.86. However, sellers have since pushed the price below that level as the U.S. session gets underway. Holding below the 100-bar moving average would open the door toward the next downside target in the 141.64–142.11 swing area. On the flip side, a failure to stay below could lead to a rebound toward the 200-hour moving average at 143.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD:
GBPUSD is pushing higher today after breaking above the 100-hour moving average at 1.3302, followed by the 200-hour moving average at 1.3326. The bullish momentum has taken the pair into a key resistance zone between 1.3362 and 1.3378. The current price is trading within that swing area. A break above would open the door toward the upper extreme for the year, between 1.3378 and 1.3441. This resistance zone marks a critical test as the U.S. session begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;65&quot; data-end=&quot;260&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Germany, political uncertainty as the first parliamentary vote to confirm PM Merz as Chancellor fell short of the required majority, receiving 310 votes versus the 316 needed. A second vote is scheduled for 14:00 BST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;262&quot; data-end=&quot;545&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In North America, trade data for March is due today. The U.S. is expected to post a substantial trade deficit of $137 billion, widening from $122.7 billion in February. Canada is also forecast to report a slightly larger deficit of $1.56 billion compared to $1.52 billion previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;547&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At 10:00 AM ET, Canada’s Ivey PMI will be released, with the prior seasonally adjusted figure at 51.3. The index tends to be volatile and usually doesn’t spark significant market reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;738&quot; data-end=&quot;883&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At 1:00 PM ET, the U.S. Treasury will auction 10-year notes. Yesterday’s 3-year note auction saw solid demand, particularly from domestic buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;1062&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In FX sentiment, a Reuters poll shows growing concern about the U.S. dollar’s safe-haven status: 46 of 83 strategists expressed concern, up from 19 of 51 in the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other data, the major US stock indices are trading lower according to the futures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -257 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -43 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -205 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the S&amp;amp;P snapped its nine-day win streak with a decline out minus 36.29 points or -0.64%. The NASDAQ index fell -0.74%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are mixed ahead of the 10 year auction at 1 PM ET:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.807%, -3.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.928%, -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.341%, -0.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.840%, +1.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Merz fell short of majority needed to become German chancellor in the first voting round. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He needed 316 votes to win a majority but didn&apos;t manage to reach that 
(only got 310 votes) even though the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition has 328 MPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAX reacted by selling off but eventually bottomed and started to recover the losses as AfD backed a new vote as early as Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another notable news was the Chinese State Council Information Office reporting that Chinese officials 
including the PBoC would hold a press conference tomorrow on financial 
policy package to stabilise market and expectations. Chinese stocks rallied on the news as expectations for a proper stimulus started to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus now switches to Trump-Carney meeting due at 11:45 ET/15:45 GMT and potential trade related headlines. There&apos;s no data release in the American session other than the 10y auction for those following them. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomber is reporting the news. This is likely an algo driven reaction to the headline but it&apos;s not something new. The EU has been threatening retaliation in case trade negotiations were to fail for a long time. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the moves get faded shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/eu-targets-100-billion-of-us-goods-with-tariffs-if-talks-fail?taid=6819f2c48745050001eb2137&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the full article&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a nice day for DAX traders as political volatility provided some nice opportunities. Below you can see the 5 minute chart of the DAX where I marked the two main headlines that triggered the biggest moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a great example for new traders on being open minded and nimble when conditions change. The fear of political instability triggered by the failure of the first voting round sent the DAX lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we started to get more and more news of support for a second round as soon as tomorrow, the fears started to ease and the dip-buyers started to pile in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s critical for a trader to be open minded and not get attached to his/her own bias when conditions change. If you took a trade because of X and something invalidates the original reason, just get out. This will not save you money in the long term, but might also improve your performance if you can also take the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We feel the market has returned to a more stable situation today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expectations of the Taiwanese dollar appreciating have mostly gone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/TWD has been more well behaved today after all the warnings since yesterday. But when you have officials put in place and scrutinising every move, that sort of helps I guess. This calls for a bit of storytelling time..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;When central banks act this way, it&apos;s usually a case of damage control and trying to cook something up to appease the media/public. I&apos;m not saying that is what is happening with Taiwan but there are cases around the world where these things do happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In my own experience, it was all the way back in 2016 when Trump pulled off a surprise to win the US election at the time. The dollar surged strongly against emerging market currencies and things really took off. I was on the trading floor and things turned quite chaotic in just a span of two to three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In just three sessions, we already saw the local currency depreciate by over 7% by the end of day close. And when we got to office early the next morning, the offshore market i.e. non-deliverable forwards were indicating a gap open with the currency set to fall by another 13% overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;An hour before the market opens, the central bank calls us and all the other banks up and tells us that we aren&apos;t allowed to quote or do any trades until further notice. We&apos;re also not allowed to perform any deals for/with clients. And they said they will be sending an officer to each bank as they think of a way to manage the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For a good six hours, we had zero trades in the local market and zero transactions with clients. All incoming calls were just deflected by a case of &quot;system issue&quot;. Clients were of course mad but they sort of understood - at least the bigger corporates - when every single bank was refusing to offer a quote, even an indicative one. We weren&apos;t even allowed to say anything about where the offshore market was trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If any trader or dealer made a quote in the market or to their clients, he/she was fired on the spot and placed &quot;under investigation&quot;. Not a joke by the way. It didn&apos;t happen with my bank but it did happen to a friend of a friend unfortunately. And he never came back to work on the trading floor after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I remember that lunch time, I stepped out and called my parents to just change whatever you can out of the local currency. It felt like that moment in the movie The Big Short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So after six hours, we were told to quote everything at the previous day closing price. Mind you, this was some 15-20% away what the offshore market was still trading. We settled our transactions and come end of day, we were told that whatever positions we have at the end of the day will be squared directly with the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, the offshore market i.e. NDFs would not be recognised anymore and starting from the next day, all incoming foreign funds into the country will be forcefully converted into the local currency at a 75% notional amount minimum. This continued for quite a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had clients with existing forward contracts and long-term FX contracts that had to be unwound because of these forced conversions. The central bank did not entertain any appeals for that and those clients lost millions on swaps. But in the end, it was a case of trying to control the narrative and put up a facade that the &quot;market&quot; was still working. On paper, it sort of looked like it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But even after nine years now, I always believe that the damage has already been done. If not through one way, then at least surely another. At one point, the local currency was even threatened to be kicked out of the MSCI basket. There was a lame workaround to circumvent that in the end though, something to do with extending trading hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But every time I look at the screen, all I can think of is this story. And when I look at the exchange rate itself, I know deep down that it doesn&apos;t fully reflect how fundamentally flawed the currency really is. If this were a free-floating exchange rate system, things would&apos;ve looked so, so much different. But alas, it was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So yeah, that&apos;s my story for today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Should You Look for in a Reliable, Secure Offshore Account?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Offshore Account Security: Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is transparency important in offshore accounts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency is essential because it allows traders to fully
understand where their account is regulated, how their funds are handled, and
what protections are in place. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot;&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;,
we clearly inform clients about the regulatory jurisdiction of each account,
whether it is FCA-cleared or offshore-regulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This openness empowers traders to make informed decisions
and avoid the risks associated with unregulated or opaque platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What regulatory credentials should you look for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evaluating an offshore account, always look for
platforms regulated by top-tier authorities. EBC holds licences from the FCA
(UK), ASIC (Australia), and CIMA (Cayman Islands). These regulators enforce
strict standards for fund segregation, client protection, and operational
transparency. Choosing a platform with multiple reputable licenses ensure your
trading environment is secure and your interests are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are client funds protected at EBC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC safeguards client funds by holding them in segregated
accounts with trusted custodians such as Barclays UK. This means your money is
kept separate from the platform’s operating funds, so even if EBC faces
financial difficulties, your capital remains protected. We never mix client and
operational funds, ensuring the highest level of fund security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What risk management features matter most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective risk management is crucial, especially with the
higher leverage available in offshore accounts. EBC provides a comprehensive
suite of tools, including stop-loss orders, negative balance protection, margin
alerts, and flexible leverage settings. These features help you control your
exposure, prevent excessive losses, and adapt your strategy to changing market
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What trading tools and user experience does EBC offer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC’s platform is designed for both novice and experienced
traders, offering advanced charting, fast execution, and robust analytical
tools. Our user-friendly interface and technology ensure you can manage trades
efficiently and take advantage of global opportunities, all while maintaining
strong risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always Secure and Transparent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing an offshore account, prioritise
transparency, strong regulation, secure fund management, and effective risk
controls. At EBC, these principles are at the core of our platform, giving you
the confidence to trade globally and securely.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The problem with a secret ballot is that it is as the name implies, a secret. That means as things stand, Merz wouldn&apos;t even know who he has to talk to in order to turn the votes around unless those who opposed owns up to it. And let&apos;s face it, that never happens in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If they just go in blindly and he loses again, it would be extremely damaging to his and the coalition&apos;s position and credibility. The risk outweighs the reward in this case. As such, it would be prudent to hold it off for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, a second vote can be called within the next 14 days now but the same ruling applies i.e. an absolute majority of 316 votes is needed to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If the second round of voting fails again, then a third round of voting must take place immediately. For that, only a relative majority i.e. candidate with the most votes, is needed to be elected as chancellor. But in this case, the president has the authority to not appoint said person to be chancellor and dissolve the Bundestag instead as an option.&lt;/p&gt;

sector output
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fastest decline in export sales since February 2021
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business activity expectations slump to a two-and-
a-half year low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;UK service sector output slipped into contraction for
the first time in one-and-a-half years as heightened
business uncertainty weighed on order books during
April. Export conditions were particularly weak, with new
business from abroad falling to the greatest extent since
February 2021.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Survey respondents often commented on the impact
of global financial market turbulence in the wake of US
tariff announcements. Businesses in the technology and
financial service sectors noted rising risk aversion and
delayed spending decisions among clients, especially in
relation to major investment plans. Consumer service
providers meanwhile cited subdued domestic economic
conditions and challenges with passing on rising payroll
costs, especially those in the hospitality and leisure
sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Input prices increased at the steepest pace since the
summer of 2023 as higher National Living Wage rates and
National Insurance contributions added to payroll costs
in April. Prices charged inflation was also the strongest
for nearly two years as service providers sought to pass
on additional costs to clients despite fragile demand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Business expectations for the year ahead fell sharply
