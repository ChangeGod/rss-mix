                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the only highlight is the BoE policy decision. The central bank is expected to cut by 25 bps bringing the bank rate to 4.25% with a 9-0 vote split (although Dhingra could vote for a 50 bps cut). This is widely expected as the BoE has been repeating that cutting once every quarter would be their preferred plan. The focus will be on the language and a potential change to the &quot;gradual and careful&quot; guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the focus will switch to the US Jobless Claims as it&apos;s the most timely indicator of the labour market. Initial Claims are expected at 230K vs 241K prior, while Continuing Claims are seen at 1886K vs 1916K prior. The market is unlikely to care much about the data unless we see a spike above the 260K level as that&apos;s been the highest level reached since 2022 and could trigger fears of a deterioration in the labour market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main event of the day will be at 14:00 GMT/10:00 ET when Trump said that he would make a big announcement concerning a major trade deal. Reports are saying that it will be a framework for a trade deal with the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is gaining some slight ground but gold is among the more noticeable movers to start the session. The precious metal is now down 0.7% on the day and touching a low of $3,336. That is running close to the 100-hour moving average (red line) of $3,330. Keep above and the near-term bias stays more bullish but break below that and the bias will turn more neutral instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latest headlines comes from the UK, with media reports confirming that Trump is to announce a &quot;heads of terms&quot; agreement i.e. framework of a deal. The announcement will take place at 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Even with this though, there will be more negotiations to follow. But after a bit of a setback with Japan, this at least will help set the tone for what may come next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, it is best to be reminded that the UK was not on the reciprocal tariffs list from the onset. This is due to the balanced nature of goods trade between the UK and the US. So, they have only been subject to the 10% blanket tariffs and steel, aluminum, auto tariffs. Is that a key factor to help with moving things along? I would argue so. So, there&apos;s that to consider too.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;UK official confirms Trump expected to announce US deal outline. The official added that the two countries had made good progress that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars. As a reminder, the US imposed the baseline 10% global tariff rate on UK.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;In light of the national two minutes of silence to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE day, the Monetary Policy Report and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting will be published at 12.02pm (BST) on Thursday 8 May 2025, instead of the regular time of 12pm (BST).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Just a heads up ahead of the decision later, in case you might wonder why there is a &quot;delay&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

The reports are suggesting this to be with the UK but the devil is in the details. As mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/risk-stays-buoyed-as-traders-eye-trumps-trade-deal-announcement-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it might not be all that is hyped up to be. So, we&apos;ll see how Trump wants to sell the narrative and if markets can continue the rebound on the week after the fact. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are seen up 0.6% currently as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior -0.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slight delay in the release by the source. UK house prices beat estimates to climb in April, with the average property price moving up to £297,781. Halifax notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know the stamp duty changes prompted a surge in transactions in the early part of this year, as
buyers rushed to beat the tax-rise deadline. However, this didn&apos;t lead to a significant increase in property prices, with the last six months characterised by a stability in prices rarely seen since the
pandemic. While the market has cooled slightly since this rush, buyer activity remains strong in
comparison to recent years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mortgage rates have continued to fall, with most lenders now offering rates below 4%. Coupled with
positive earnings growth that has outpaced broader inflation, these factors have helped to steadily
improve affordability for many buyers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the market continues to show resilience despite a subdued economic environment and risks
from geopolitical developments. There is likely to be a bump-up in consumer price inflation as
household bills increase, but with further base rate cuts also expected, we anticipate a similar trend of
modest price growth this year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China premier Li reportedly set for visit to Malaysia later this month</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The visit will be in conjunction with the 2nd ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit that will take place on 27 May. The sources say that Chinese premier Li Qiang will be a high-profile attendee as Beijing hopes to rally more allies in fighting back against US tariffs. Li&apos;s visit will follow up on China president Xi&apos;s own visit to Malaysia as well from last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;One of the sources mentioned that trade is expected to be high on the agenda with regards to discussions during the summit. It is unclear if Li will also be in attendance for the ASEAN Summit itself, which will take place on 26 May in Malaysia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides the summit, Malaysia itself is an important strategic trade player caught in the US-China trade war. So, China&apos;s agenda here could be two-fold. For one, Malaysia is one of the more popular grounds for origin washing as noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/how-china-has-been-preparing-itself-ahead-of-this-tariffs-eventuality-with-the-us-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And after China, Malaysia is the next biggest exporter of rare earth minerals to the US. The gap between the two is massive of course but at around 13% (rest of the world ex China combined is only 17%), it&apos;s not an insignificant amount.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There is just one to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That being for EUR/USD at the 1.1300 level. It isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance though, so the impact might not be too striking. But amid a bit of a wait until we get to Trump&apos;s trade deal announcement, the expiries could help to provide a bit of a magnet for price action in the session ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But as has been the case in the past two to three weeks, it&apos;s all about trade headlines and the risk mood. So, those will remain as the key drivers of trading sentiment as we look to the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But as per the latest report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/wsj-trump-is-expected-to-announce-a-framework-of-a-trade-deal-with-the-uk-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that the so-called deal is just an agreement for negotiations to begin. It will just involve a framework for discussions over the coming weeks/months. So, we&apos;ll see about that. But as always, one can expect Trump to talk up a big game and that is keeping markets hopeful ahead of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Risk trades are holding up once again with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures now up 0.8%. That follows from the overnight gains but it was far from straightforward. The Fed stood their ground and that briefly saw US stocks pare gains before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-report-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;this late headline&lt;/a&gt; helped to salvage things. A word of caution of course that the devil is in the details regarding that report on chips but markets are running with it anyway for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Going back to Trump&apos;s announcement, it will be interesting to see how he wants to sell the narrative. The details will also be of much importance, so be on the lookout for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, it&apos;s still a case of buying the rumour. Will it end up being a sell the fact play before the end of today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s announcement is expected at 1400 GMT later.&lt;/p&gt;

It was
a relatively quiet headline day today with just a couple of nuggets. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Bank of Japan published the minutes of its March meeting. The Bank
left monetary policy unchanged at this meeting. There was debate
around the policy board table, summarised as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S.
tariff policies are seen as a key downside risk to Japan’s economy.
Some BOJ members thus urge caution in tightening policy further.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others
believe decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Its
unsurprising that there was some debate, with inflation in the country
having risen and real rates remaining very accommodative (negative!), but the cautious view prevailed, as it did again at the
subsequent meeting on April 30/May1 when policy was left once again
on hold. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;USD/JPY
didn’t do too much upon the release of the minutes, holding near
143.80 and thereabouts before drifting lower on the Trump
announcement later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Trump
posted to his own social media app that he will announce a “major”
trade deal on Thursday at 10am US Eastern time. US media (New York
Times) reports that the trade deal will be with the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
equity index futures traded higher on Globex on the back of the post
from Trump. Across major FX the USD lost some ground alongside. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Wall Street Journal took a more constrained view, reporting that 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“This
announcement is likely just an agreement to start the negotiations,
identifying a framework of issues to be discussed in the coming
months”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are responding to Trump more than the WSJ as I update, with US equity index futures extending their gains. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Uh-oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal is pouring some cold water on the earlier headlines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The announcement, which Trump teased late Wednesday on Truth Social as being with a “big, and highly respected country,” is expected to be a framework of an announcement with tariff adjustments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“This announcement is likely just an agreement to start the negotiations, identifying a framework of issues to be discussed in the coming months,” said international trade attorney Tim Brightbill. “We suspect that tariff rates, non-tariff barriers, and digital trade are all on the list—and there are difficult issues to address on all of these.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolding is mine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-spruiks-a-major-trade-deal-announcement-thursday-morning-in-washington-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Trump spruiks a major trade deal announcement Thursday morning in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/pavlovs-dog-takes-us-equities-higher-on-trumps-major-trade-deal-teaser-announcement-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Pavlov&apos;s dog takes US equities higher on Trump&apos;s &quot;major trade deal&quot; teaser announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/new-york-times-says-trump-will-announce-a-trade-deal-with-the-uk-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;New York Times says Trump will announce a trade deal with the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I posted a summary of the Bank of Japan March meeting minutes here earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-minutes-bank-will-raise-rates-if-economic-and-price-projections-realised-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;BoJ minutes: Bank will raise rates if economic and price projections realised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that post you&apos;ll find some points being made in favour of staying on hold, and other points being made saying the Bank needs to able to respond quickly if needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters have summarised the minutes and say this divergence is views is a split. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOJ Split Over Next Rate Hike Amid U.S. Tariff Uncertainty

 Summary:

Bank of Japan policymakers were divided in March on when to raise rates again, as escalating U.S. tariff risks threatened Japan’s economic outlook.

While some called for caution, others argued the BOJ might still need to act decisively despite global uncertainties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Key Points:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
•  BOJ minutes reveal division over the pace of future rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  U.S. tariff policies are seen as a key downside risk to Japan’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  Some BOJ members urge caution in tightening policy further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  Others believe decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
•  The debate underscores rising pressure on Japan’s monetary strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think &apos;split&apos; is too strong a description. I think &apos;caution&apos; and &apos;decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks&apos; are not, at this time, a split. The overall message from the minutes, and from subsequent BoJ communication, is that there is still time to watch and wait. &lt;/p&gt;

It remains unclear whether the deal is finalized or if it represents a framework for continued negotiations.
Unlike other countries, Britain was not hit with additional “reciprocal” tariffs due to its trade surplus with the U.S., though it remains subject to a 10% global tariff and a 25% levy on steel, aluminum, and cars. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK was my pick. But ... I don&apos;t know about anyone else but I&apos;ve lost count of how many times the NYT has been wrong about what to expect from Trump. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

A central feature under consideration is the use of tariff revenues as a core funding source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;585&quot; data-end=&quot;847&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly exploring a strategy that would leverage both liquid reserves and domestic assets, with the fund potentially combining investment and development functions — similar to sovereign wealth models used globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;849&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The White House said the proposal is part of the administration’s broader strategy to use every available tool to safeguard U.S. national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;
