                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $61.95. That is up $0.93 or 1.52%. The high price reached $63.57. The low price was at $61.04. The price is up for the third consecutive day. Since the low reached on May 5, the price is up 11.48%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, there is a swing area between $62.46 and $65.29 (see yellow area on the chart above).. In between that area lies the 50% midpoint of the range since the 2020 low. That level comes in at $64.71&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) U.S. POSTS $258B APRIL BUDGET SURPLUS, UP 23%

Strong tax payments and record import tariffs boosted the U.S. April surplus to $258B, Treasury reported.

🔸 $16B in customs duties, up $9B from last year.
🔸 U.S. collected $500M/day from tariffs, far below Trump&apos;s $2B/day claim.
🔸 Tariff revenue will fall as U.S.-China agreed to cut tariffs (U.S. to 30%, China to 10%) for 90 days.

For fiscal 2025 (Oct-Apr):

🔸 Deficit: $1.049T, up 23%.
🔸 Receipts: $3.11T, Outlays: $4.16T — both April records.
🔸 Adjusted for timing effects, the deficit rose 4%.</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;March was -161B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last April was +210B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;April is always the best month of the US for the US budget due to income tax receipts. Even on those terms it ranks as the second-best April on record. That said, timing shifts around Easter and how the days of the week land in any given month can affect how many pay periods there are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These budget numbers are rarely a market mover but they&apos;re a good reminder that Congress will one day have to bring down spending or raise more money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) CHINA TRADE EASING DOESN&apos;T MEAN A QUICK FED CUT: DEUTSCHE BANK

A big drop in U.S.-China trade barriers lessens the prospects of a serious inflationary supply crunch. Even so, inflation remains stubborn enough that the Fed probably still won&apos;t be in a rush to cut interest rates, economists at Deutsche Bank write. Despite the trade war&apos;s easing, &quot;policies are likely to keep inflation at uncomfortably high levels for the Fed,&quot; Deutsche&apos;s team suggests. &quot;This announcement therefore reinforces our view that the Fed is going to be slow to cut rates this year.&quot; Deutsche&apos;s baseline assumption is that the Fed&apos;s next rate cut won&apos;t come before December</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is at the highs of the day, up 3.1% while the Nasdaq is up 4.2% as buying turns into a feeding frenzy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next mark to watch is the futures overnight high of 5865 as we&apos;re about 6 points from that now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s an impressive rally as the early sellers have been overcome by fresh money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold on pace for its worst day since November 2024</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The flight into gold is having a tough time today after the weekend news on tariff relief at least for the next 90 days between the US and China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price is currently down -$101 or -3.06% at $3224.21. The dollar decline is the largest one-day decline on record. On a percentage basis, the decline is the worst since the price fell -3.35% back on November 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, the low price from May 1 reached $3202.03. The low price today reach $3207.95 so far. Moving below that level should open the door for further downside momentum with the 38.2% retracement of the move up from the November 2024 low the next major target at $3132.16. Below that a trendline cuts across at $3082.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would take a while to get to the rising 100 day moving which is currently at $2953.80. That is also near the swing low going back to April 7 (I guess it wasn&apos;t that long ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading year, the price of gold is still up 22.83% after rising 27.22% in 2024 and 13.16% in 2023. If tariff risks decline, we could see a liquidation of the precious metal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BOE Taylor: We are a long way from neutral level of interest rates</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;BOE Taylor says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are a long way from the neutral level of interest rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neutral rate for me is 2.75 – 3% in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erosion of business confidence in the UK has continued in REC and PMI surveys..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a sense of precaution and concernt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff shock was bigger than anyone expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although there are signs of a pause, we don&apos;t know where it will go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wage settlement data is coming in line with expectations for slower wage growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Central forecast of BOE had quite mild treatment of global trade situation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK/US trade deal is quite slender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Bank of England reduced its base interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%, marking the fourth cut since August 2024. The decision was made amid easing inflationary pressures and concerns over global economic uncertainties, particularly stemming from recent U.S. tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monetary Policy Committee&apos;s vote was notably divided. The decision was supported by five members: Governor Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, and Dave Ramsden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two members including  Swati Dhingra and Taylor, advocated for a larger 0.5 percentage point cut, citing concerns over subdued inflation and potential impacts from global trade tensions. Taylor&apos;s comments support his bias.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Catherine L. Mann and Chief Economist Huw Pill voted to maintain the rate at 4.5%, expressing worries about persistent inflation pressures, particularly from wage growth and services inflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This three-way split underscores the MPC&apos;s differing views on balancing inflation risks against economic growth considerations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While inflation stood at 2.6% in March, the Bank anticipates a temporary rise to 3.5% in the third quarter due to factors like higher energy prices, before returning to the 2% target by early 2027 . The Bank also highlighted that recent U.S. tariff increases are expected to weigh on global growth, adding to the cautious outlook for the UK economy .&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;182&quot; data-end=&quot;412&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD has shifted lower after breaking beneath a key support confluence, including the 200-day moving average at 0.5883 and a price floor near that level. The move signals growing bearish momentum as sellers gain control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;414&quot; data-end=&quot;780&quot;&gt;Support is now found at the swing area between 0.5852 and 0.5860, with the pair testing the low of that zone. A move below would target the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which comes in at 0.5847. Below that, the 38.2% retracement of the April move up, at 0.58204, serves as the next critical downside level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;782&quot; data-end=&quot;995&quot;&gt;To sustain the bearish shift, NZDUSD needs to stay below the 0.5852–0.5860 area, or more conservatively for sellers looking for more downside, the 200 day MA at 0.5883. Staying below would ultimately need a break and hold under 0.5820. Failure to do so could invite dip buyers and shift control back toward the bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1010&quot; data-end=&quot;1236&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1010&quot; data-end=&quot;1063&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1012&quot; data-end=&quot;1063&quot;&gt;Broke below 200-day MA at 0.5883 and support floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1064&quot; data-end=&quot;1100&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1066&quot; data-end=&quot;1100&quot;&gt;Swing area support: 0.5852–0.5860.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1101&quot; data-end=&quot;1182&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1103&quot; data-end=&quot;1182&quot;&gt;Key downside targets: 0.5847 (200-bar MA on 4H) and 0.5820 (38.2% retracement).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1183&quot; data-end=&quot;1236&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1185&quot; data-end=&quot;1236&quot;&gt;Staying below 0.5820 would confirm seller control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;For the last six weeks, everyone in markets has been contemplating a reordering of world markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we&apos;re back to where we started in tariff rates and in markets. That has Deutsche Bank wonder: What was the point of all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They note that the latest data shows China exports to the US on a steady decline with April 2025 imports at the lowest in real terms since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Previously, we were convinced they were likely
to be very hawkish towards China and the two nations would continue to decouple
and that the massive imbalance between the two nations&apos; manufacturing output
and the national security concerns would ensure the ideology remained
throughout the term,&quot; writes DB multi-asset strategist Jim Reid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll be honest – I have more questions than answers at
the moment but it seems that: (1) more pragmatic voices in the US
administration have taken control again; (2) the near-term economy is being
prioritised over the long-term security agenda; (3) the US needs trade to
continue for now, and perhaps overestimated the leverage high tariffs would
give them in extracting concessions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So were the last six weeks all a bad dream? Will the
unpredictable nature of US policy continue or are we now on a more conventional
path? Not sure I have the answers this morning but, if you&apos;re looking for
positives, US policy does seem to have galvanised Europe, is encouraging China
to rebalance towards consumption and Bessent has even discussed how the trade
deficit may be partly being caused by the fiscal deficit. So maybe US policy
has been a force for good?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a common sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;142&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot;&gt;The USDCAD has extended its gains and pushed above the key 1.4000 level, reaching a high of 1.40043. The next upside target comes in at the 200-day moving average at 1.40106, followed by resistance at 1.40268, a prior swing area high. Beyond that, the 38.2% retracement of the decline from the March 2025 high sits at 1.40525, marking a more significant hurdle for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;765&quot;&gt;The earlier dip in price found support at 1.3977, the April 15 swing high, where buyers leaned in and reasserted control. That successful retest reinforced the bullish bias and helped fuel the move back toward and through 1.4000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;767&quot; data-end=&quot;1040&quot;&gt;While the break above 1.4000 is constructive, buyers still have work to do. A sustained move above the 200-day moving average, and ultimately the 1.40525 retracement level, is needed to confirm a stronger upside shift. For now, momentum remains with the buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re an executive right now, what are you focused on: tariffs or competing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalism works best when companies have a clear set of rules and can fight for market share. Today&apos;s news is undoubtedly good on tariffs but it&apos;s a 90-day pause, similar to the &apos;liberation day&apos; climb-down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today&apos;s environment there is so much uncertainty. There are few executives with international supply chains that are right now focused on gaining market share. Instead, they&apos;re trying to navigate changing rules, stockpile and manage inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are probably opportunities to undercut competitors but if competitors can&apos;t respond and the moves are temporary, does that really create sustained disinflation? I&apos;d argue that it simply leads to turmoil in pricing that resets with weaker competitive dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guess is this is how the Fed sees it as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe right now isn&apos;t there for disinflation in the world as companies are writing tariff clauses into contracts and stuffing warehouses. Right now they have to decide if they want to pay 30% tariffs on Chinese goods or risk waiting around for a better/worse deal later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bull case now for risk assets and the US dollar is the massive tax cut package that Republicans are working on. I&apos;d say a good deal of that is already priced in but certainly not all of it. It&apos;s looking like it will be paid for via Medicaid cuts and massive deficits. Even with that it&apos;s mostly a continuation of the regime that&apos;s already in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you look out further at some point you need to price in a tightening fiscal regime. The US is running at deficit at 7% of GDP and tariffs and DOGE aren&apos;t going to pay for much at all. The Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation is just out with an analysis saying the tax bill will cost $4.9 trillion over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d imaging there will be cheers in markets when that&apos;s passed but at some point, it will need to be paid for so at some point you need to price in some level of austerity.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;162&quot; data-end=&quot;501&quot;&gt;The NASDAQ Composite Index has broken back above the 200-day moving average (green line on the chart at 18,320.79) and 100-day moving average (blue line at 18,476.49)  —a technical development that marks a shift in the medium-term trend. These MA levels were broken for the last time (to the downside) on March 6 and had not traded above since that day. The price gapped above the MAs today off of the weekend news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;162&quot; data-end=&quot;501&quot;&gt;The NASDAQ index is currently up 630.2 or 3.5% at 18557.63 above both those moving averages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;503&quot; data-end=&quot;802&quot;&gt;With the index breaking back above those MAs, they become the bias-defining levels today and going forward.  Staying above is more bullish with a swing area between 18599 and 18832 as the next area to get and stay above (see yellow area on the chart above).  A move above those levels takes the price back into the all-time upper extreme that peaked at 20204.58 back on December 16, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1015&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1016&quot; data-end=&quot;1291&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1016&quot; data-end=&quot;1091&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1018&quot; data-end=&quot;1091&quot;&gt;100-day and 200-day MAs between 18320.88 and 18,476.49 have been broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1092&quot; data-end=&quot;1144&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1094&quot; data-end=&quot;1144&quot;&gt;Bullish bias now in place with buyers in control above the moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1145&quot; data-end=&quot;1221&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1147&quot; data-end=&quot;1221&quot;&gt;Key upside targets are between swing area at 18598.87 and 18831.91&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index has also broken above its key 200-day moving average at 5750.18 and it&apos;s 100 day moving average at 5773.64. The current price trades at 5811.31 up 151.42 points or 2.67%. There is a swing area between 5782.02 and 5878.47 which if broken would take the price into the upper all-time extreme that peaked at 6147.43.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to know why we were as desperate for a deal as the Chinese, it’s because small businesses — a key MAGA constituency— was about to get crushed&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The problem with this rally is that it was front-run hard. The tide really turned on the market after Bessent&apos;s private comments and the White House private meeting with Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other retailers. A hint of that was that shipping out of China has spiked in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lingering sense that too many people knew this was coming and that much of the buying the past three weeks was in anticipation of today. Yes, the details are probably better than expected but there may have been some massive leveraged trades betting on exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they&apos;re taking profits in an economy that&apos;s still wracked by turmoil and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still think the path is ultimately higher but is there enough here to chase markets to fresh all-time highs?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;193&quot; data-end=&quot;494&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD attempted a move higher and outside a swing area with a high at 0.64419. However, once again the high price stalled at the 200-day moving average, located near 0.6458, turning buyers into sellers. The price stalled near that MA on Thursday of last week (the price moved briefly above that level but quickly reversed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;193&quot; data-end=&quot;494&quot;&gt;The rejection at this key level has pushed the pair back below the converged 100/200 hour MAa at 0.64349 and with that, back into the red-box range, suggesting a shift back to neutral-to-bearish bias in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;496&quot; data-end=&quot;568&quot;&gt;With momentum now pointing lower, immediate support targets include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;569&quot; data-end=&quot;773&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;569&quot; data-end=&quot;601&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;571&quot; data-end=&quot;601&quot;&gt;The swing level at 0.63646&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;602&quot; data-end=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;604&quot; data-end=&quot;650&quot;&gt;The high of the lower swing area at 0.63437&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;651&quot; data-end=&quot;730&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;653&quot; data-end=&quot;730&quot;&gt;The 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, currently near 0.6325&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;731&quot; data-end=&quot;773&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;733&quot; data-end=&quot;773&quot;&gt;The low of the swing area at 0.63216&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;775&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;A break below 0.63216 would increase bearish pressure and open the door for further declines with the 100-day MA at 0.6289 and the 38.2% of the move up from the April low at 0.62844.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;775&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot;&gt; Conversely, start to move back above the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart, and the 100/200 hour MAs at 0.64399 would disappoint the sellers.  A move back above the  200-day MA, would be a bigger disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;775&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;Sellers are making a play  but in the wake of the move higher that peaked last week at 0.65135, has left a number of targets that need to be broken to increase the bearish bias.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1002&quot; data-end=&quot;1014&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1015&quot; data-end=&quot;1217&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1015&quot; data-end=&quot;1071&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1017&quot; data-end=&quot;1071&quot;&gt;Rejection at the 200-day MA caps the upside at 0.6458. Bias shifted lower while below the 200-day MA, 100/200 hour MA and 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1072&quot; data-end=&quot;1116&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1074&quot; data-end=&quot;1116&quot;&gt;Price falls back into consolidation range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1117&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot;&gt;Support targets: 0.63646, 0.6347, 0.6335, 0.63216 (low of consolidation range going back to April 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1217&quot;&gt;Other lower target include the 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.6325 adn then the 200 day MA at 0.6286.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The market is priced for a 45% chance of a cut in July and 81 bps in the year ahead (down from 131 bps three weeks ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If tariffs are long lasting, the one issue I would be looking to is how supply chains get rearranged in the rest of the world&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m one of those who believes there could be some permanency on price increases related to tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re negotiating with India right now (on trade)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US helped a lot of with India-Pakistan ceasefire&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreement doesn&apos;t cover steel, aluminum, cars or pharma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he spoke to Tim Cook this morning; Cook will built a lot in the USA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks in Geneva were friendly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re not looking to hurt China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will speak to Xi at the end of the week maybe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China was honoring the &apos;phase 1&apos; deal until Biden came in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a big incentive for China to stop sending fentanyl, I take them at their word they will make it stop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will no longer tolerate profiteering from big pharma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drug policy change will pay for &apos;golden dome&apos; missile defense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blow things up and then take credit for a &apos;total reset&apos;; I guess that&apos;s the art of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I just called the Speaker of the House and I just called the leader, our leader in the Senate, John Thune..spoke to both of them. I said, when &quot;You&apos;re going to have to score two things. You&apos;re going to have to number one, score that hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money is coming in. But even bigger than that, you&apos;re going to have to score that year. Your cost for Medicaid and Medicare and just basically pharmaceuticals and drugs is going down at a level that nobody has ever seen before. It&apos;ll pay for the Golden Dome.&quot; I see the Golden dome is there. See? That&apos;ll easily pay for the Golden Dome. And we&apos;ll have a lot of money left over.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times is Trump going to count that tariff revenue? It&apos;s paying for tax cuts, subsidize for farmers and now for missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USDCAD has moved higher in response to the lower China/US tariffs (or suspension of the tariffs) and the overall USD buying. The price has risen toward a cluse or MAs, swing and retracement targets starting with the: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;200 are moving average on the 4-hour chart at 1.39874.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 200 day moving average of 1.40106,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swing area between 1.4009 and 1.40268, and the &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;38.2% retracement of the move down from the March high. That level comes in at 1.40525&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high price has reached 1.39983 and is waffling above the high price from March 15 at 1.3977, and the overhead resistance near the aforementioned technical targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, I go through the technical clues that are driving this currency pair. Be aware. Be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump is set to talk about pharma at a press conference imminently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President wrote yesterday about a plan for prescription drugs that would shift costs to other countries. That has pharma companies struggling against a very strong tape today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much in the way of macro drivers in the pharma-specific comments but Trump will surely be asked about China so watch out for those comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDCHF Technical Update: Price extends higher after breaking out of consolidation</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;87&quot; data-end=&quot;226&quot;&gt;The USDCHF has made a notable technical breakout, moving above a key consolidation area and extending higher toward retracement resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;228&quot; data-end=&quot;511&quot;&gt;On the hourly chart, the price had been confined within a red-box consolidation zone, capped by resistance near 0.8333. After several failed attempts, the pair finally broke above the top of that box and found support on a retest, using the 0.8333 level as a base to push higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;513&quot; data-end=&quot;794&quot;&gt;On the 4-hour chart (see chart below), the pair surged into a key swing area between 0.8373 and 0.84087, which also includes the 200-bar moving average, currently near 0.8383. The price broke above the area with momentum today.  This zone is now a critical support area and represents close risk for buyers looking to maintain the bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;796&quot; data-end=&quot;1017&quot;&gt;To the upside, the next major resistance comes at the 38.2% retracement of the move down from the January high, which is being tested near 0.84823. A move above this level would open the door for further upside extension and represents the minimum retracement target to get to and through if the buyers are to take more control. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1019&quot; data-end=&quot;1031&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1032&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1032&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1034&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;Breakout above hourly range high at 0.8333, now support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1093&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot;&gt;Support zone: 0.8373–0.84087 (includes 200-bar MA on 4-hour at 0.8383).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot;&gt;Resistance: 38.2% retracement at 0.84823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1209&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1211&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;A hold above the 4-hour swing area support keeps the bias tilted higher, but getting above the 38.2% retracement is a required target for the buyers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Gold is being put to the test today</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;There are many winners in today&apos;s market action but there is a big loser as well: Gold. It&apos;s down $95 to $3228 today as the great decoupling may not happen after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news looks bad for gold but I&apos;m carefully watching the technicals. Gold has so far held the May 1 low of $3201 and that&apos;s a good sign for the bulls. We&apos;ve seen some heavy gold selling in the New York 9 am hour through the equity open in the past year so I think that&apos;s a delicate time. If it can hold here and if Trump strikes a less-aggressive tone on the trade war then I think we can see a deeper selloff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-05-09/wall-street-balanced-between-bulls-bears-and-fence-main-street-maintains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kitco News&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and laid out how I was thinking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, said it&apos;s tough not to be bullish on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitco.com/charts/gold&quot;&gt;gold &lt;/a&gt;these days, but the de-escalation between the United States and China has the potential to sap the yellow metal’s momentum.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The meeting this weekend is high stakes,” he said. “People are saying 50%, then Trump&apos;s saying 80% today. We’ve built in some expectation of lower tariffs between China and the U.S., and it’s tough to judge how much is priced in and what might be the effect. If we come out of the weekend at 50%, I think we&apos;re going to see gold sell off and we&apos;ll see the riskier assets continue [higher].”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I don&apos;t think 50% would be the end goal, but it would be pretty rapid progress and a nice sign for both sides.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Button said that gold is acting as the best financial barometer of the state of global trade these days. “Gold is clearly now finding itself as a trade on global trade, a ‘trade-war-on/trade-war-off’ asset,” he said. “For the week ahead, if China tariffs come down, if U.S. tariffs come down… I think that you don&apos;t have a meeting without a plan to offer something, so they’ve both ratcheted down a little bit. I think any progress in that direction is negative for gold for the week ahead.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I would say gold looks to be carving out a range at the top end,” Button added. “If you pull back, gold went from $2,500 to $3,500 in a straight line, and now it&apos;s consolidating in a $300 range at the top without a really big pullback. This is the best the bulls could hope for. It was nice to talk about $4,000 or $10,000 or whatever, but if gold can spend a month or two right around these levels, that&apos;s bullish long term.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>US-China breakthrough leads to a breakout</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China are down to 30% while China tariffs on the US are set at 10%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the massive cut in tariffs, 20 percentage points of the US tariffs on China are due to fentanyl and I think there is a path to lowering or eliminating that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is for 90 days but Treasury Secretary Bessent said that could be extended so long as negotiations are headed in the right direction. I think that leaves importers in a tough spot as they will have to decide on whether to stockpile with 30% tariffs or risk a better/worse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now though, there is a huge sigh of relief in markets with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures up 3.2%, oil up 4%, USD/JPY up 280 pips and 2-year yields up 11 bps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message there is that US, Chinese and global growth prospects just got much better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is a test: Can these moves be sustained or is there still some skepticism? That will tell us about the underlying strength of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you have to be optimistic here as it looks like Trump doesn&apos;t have the appetite for a trade war after all and he&apos;s pivoting toward opening up China for US companies. Was the Trump Put in all along?&lt;/p&gt;
