                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continued its move to the upside after breaking above the 100-hour moving average at 0.82556. That level became a springboard for buyers, who stepped in and pushed the pair higher during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;486&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier in the week, the 200-hour moving average (green line) provided support, helping to form a base for the current rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;488&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next key resistance area comes in between 0.83184 and 0.8333â€”the highs from Monday and Friday. Just above that sits the 38.2% retracement of the April decline, which comes in at 0.8350. This creates a major target and decision area for traders. Getting above the 38.2% after a trend move is required to show the buyers are willing to take more control. It is the minimum retracement target.  Absent a break of it, the buyers are not winning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;488&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, the technical optics are more positive with support at the 200 earlier this week, and support at the 100 hour MA today, showing buying interest.  There is work to do, but the buyers are making a play. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are at the heart of the trade war and today&apos;s ISM survey of the industry gave the market some solace: Orders aren&apos;t collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that with largely upbeat commentary from corporates as Q1 earnings roll out and the world is feeling better about the tariff war. I&apos;d caution that could be premature but there are also indications that Trump is backing off on the trade war as the US calls China and gets set to announce a deal later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is Friday&apos;s non-farm payrolls report and there could be some volatility there but I just don&apos;t see many companies talking about layoffs at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prelim was 50.7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 50.2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panelists noted an increased apprehension in product
markets, mainly around the future direction of US trade policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business confidence at 10 month low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; stocks of finished goods were reduced for a fifth
month in a row, and to the greatest degree of the year so far&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m surprised that inventories have been drawn down so deeply and it points to a rough hit from shortages than anticipated, and sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P
Global Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Manufacturing continued to flat-line in April amid
worrying downside risks to the outlook and sharply rising
costs.
&quot;Factory output fell for a second successive month as
tariffs were widely blamed on a slump in export orders
and curbed spending among customers more broadly
amid rising uncertainty.
&quot;Although the survey saw some producers report
evidence of beneficial tariff-related switching of
customer demand away from imports, any such sales
increase was countered by worries over tariff-related
disruptions to supply chains and lost export sales. This
served to drive business confidence about prospects
in the year ahead down sharply to the gloomiest for 10
months.
&quot;Concerns have also spiked in terms of input costs,
especially for imported materials and components, due
to the triple whammy of tariff-related price hikes, supply
shortages, and the weaker dollar.
&quot;Manufacturers are responding to these changing
demand, supply and cost conditions by raising their
selling prices and trimming headcounts to help protect
their margins.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EV sales down 39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hybrids up 29.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICE up 17.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting number because it shows that the race to beat the tariffs was real. That&apos;s going to create a bullwhip effect down the line and it shows a real effect on consumer behaviour. That&apos;s going to lead to a blockbuster April retail sales report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford shares are up 1% premarket, which puts them right back to where they were in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This was an interesting tease from Hassett on tariff deals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like the person in the middle of all that is Jamieson Greer and Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect this will be an announcement of a deal with India, where there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/a-good-bet-on-what-the-country-is-that-is-near-a-trade-deal-with-the-usa-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;mounting signs&lt;/a&gt; of a deal. The contours of that will be key, particularly if the US is will to lower its tariff floor below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The market appears to be coming around to the idea that the US economy is fine, or at least that it was fine before April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of upbeat commentary from Visa and the internals of yesterday&apos;s GDP report has the market thinking that the economy is on strong footing. The recent initial jobless claims numbers bear that out but that set will be tested again today. The consensus is 224K, up a touch from 222K a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then at 10 am ET, the focus will shift to the industrial economy with March construction spending and April ISM manufacturing. The latter is expected to slip to 48.0 from 49.0. Lately there has been a focus on the &apos;prices paid&apos; numbers as well but with oil prices cratering, the market is seeing more room for the Fed to cut rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude was last down $1.21 to $57.00.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US stocks have moved higher led by sharp gains in Meta and Microsoft after the close yesterday. That has the USDJPY moving higher with a bit of risk on and dovish comments from BOJ Ueda.  The EURUSD and GBPUSD have seen down and up price action today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN this video, I take a technical look at the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD from a technical perspective and outline the key levels in play and explain why.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware. Be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

That is leading to markets thinking about a further pause on rates in June next, following the decision today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY nudged higher from 144.20 to 144.75 during the presser and is still largely holding gains, seen up 1% at 144.50 levels now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, there wasn&apos;t too much action in the FX space. The dollar is keeping steadier across the board, but mostly little changed against the other major currencies. EUR/USD is lightly down by 0.1% to 1.1320 but was hovering around 1.1300 at the tail end of Asia trading. Meanwhile, GBP/USD is flat at 1.3325 and USD/CAD just up slightly by 0.2% to 1.3823 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, US futures are keeping higher after the late rebound from Wall Street yesterday. And the mood is helped by a jump up in tech shares after stronger earnings from Meta and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had US Treasury secretary Bessent out with some remarks as well but nothing that is too meaningful, mainly just a repeat of what we&apos;ve heard before. It&apos;s now more about walking the walk, not talking the talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The bond market is also continuing to hold the calm, so that&apos;s keeping the risk mood in a better spot to start the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the commodities space, gold is pushed down as it breaks away from its recent consolidation. The $3,200 level is now eyed next amid the break from the short-term technical range over the past week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Oil was a bit of a standout mover as it dipped down to a low of $56.40 as concerns continue to grow on multiple fronts on the oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We expect to see GDP revised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP decline may have been due to inventory stocking of imports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US households consumption is strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yields below Federal Funds Rate is signal that the Fed should cut rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our policies will bring down inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bolded comment is a classic &quot;rule of thumb&quot; in the markets. When the 2 year yield falls below the FFR, it&apos;s a signal that the market views the tightening cycle over and expects the Fed to cut rates soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that it&apos;s based on markets expectations and they can be wrong at times. We saw that in 2023 when the 2 year yield has been below the FFR for a long time but then went all the way back to match the FFR. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 105,441 job cuts last month is 63% higher compared to the same month last year. That brings the year-to-date total to 602,493 layoffs now, which is the highest since 2020. For some context, the figure is some 87% higher compared to the first four months of 2024. It once again underscores the impact of the DOGE layoffs, with 281,452 of those job cuts being directly attributed to that.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Bessent sounds like he got a good whipping before coming out with his remarks today. But if the idea is to try and convince that there is a plan, the headline remark doesn&apos;t really help to be honest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-needs-the-answer-to-this-question-what-are-tariffs-for-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;The market needs the answer to this question: What are tariffs for?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He&apos;s basically telling us that the markets and the economy are indeed important for them despite Trump saying that he doesn&apos;t care as long as he gets what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The near 3% drop today sees oil poised for a potential decline of over 10% this week with not much reprieve in sight. The previous low in April this year touched $55.15 before a bounce on the tariffs pause. But even then, it hardly resulted in a change in confidence in the oil market. In fact, as things went on one can argue that we&apos;re seeing the developments turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latest news from Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t add much encouragement whatsoever to an already struggling outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the global economic backdrop set to soften amid tariffs and demand conditions also hit hard by the US-China trade standoff, the fact that OPEC+ continues to push for output increases is just adding a heavy burden to oil prices in the current landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s a tough one to weed out and the only saving grace looks to be a turning point on the tariffs front. That will be a key spot to watch for oil, considering it is getting little help elsewhere - in particular from OPEC+ and its members.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A non-consensus trading opportunity as the selloff in crude oil gathers attention</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The crude oil market experienced a rough month due to Trump&apos;s aggressive tariffs announcement on April 2 that made the market to expect lower demand on the slowdown in the global economy coupled with higher supply as OPEC+ planned to increase production by more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw a strong rebound though on April 9 as Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and the market expected more de-escalation and started to price out the global slowdown. The delay in reaching the trade deals and fresh positive supply news eventually weighed on the sentiment and prices rolled over once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, crude oil extended the selloff as we got the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; news &lt;/a&gt;that the Saudi officials have told allies that they can sustain a prolonged period of low prices in what sounded like a threat of a price war. The focus is clearly on supply right now, but a non-consensus trade opportunity could be in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ocean container bookings have seen a significant decline since the tariffs announcement with bookings from China to US being down 60%. If Trump eases tariffs, we could experience a covid-like bullwhip effect where all those cancelled orders get rebooked creating a huge surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectations for strong demand and a rebound in global growth will likely push prices higher and a rally to the 70.00 handle on WTI wouldn&apos;t be surprising. But being a contrarian is not enough because you have to get the timing right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Steinhardt, a trading legend, once said that ideally you should be able to tell, in two minutes, four things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the consensus view&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the variant perception&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the trigger event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trigger event, in my opinion, could be the details of the first trade deal. Markets will derive future expectations from that first deal. I think an average tariff rate of 10% or lower (the lower the better), would be the catalyst for a rally in crude oil prices. The idea would be invalidated in case we get a higher rate of course. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump tariffs to have &apos;tremendously adverse&apos; impact on the US economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They &apos;hobble&apos; companies that rely on critical minerals supplies from China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 40% of goods imported into the country were inputs for domestic production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odds for a recession have gone up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs could be particularly problematic for the US clean energy sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are highly dependent on China for most of the critical minerals that go into the clean energy technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a very consensus view that tariffs will likely have an adverse impact on the US economy and that the recession probabilities have gone up. The market priced that in soon after the April 2 announcement, but started to price out that view after Trump&apos;s pause on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now looking forward to positive resolutions that will eventually trigger the opposite effect: the US economy will bounce back and economic activity will rise. That&apos;s why trade talks and negotiations are critical. If they disappoint the market, then we will likely go back to price in the recession. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is mostly tech shares leading the charge though with Nasdaq futures marked up by 1.4% currently. The late rebound yesterday was certainly intriguing but it&apos;s been followed up with some better earnings releases from Meta and Microsoft. Dip buyers are continuing to hold the line with the S&amp;amp;P 500 looking to build on last week&apos;s push above 5,500.

                            &lt;p&gt;Many individuals and families across the United States face
financial hardship, often struggling to cover essential expenses such as rent,
utilities, childcare, and medical bills. Navigating the complex landscape of
financial assistance programs can be overwhelming, especially for those who are
unsure of where to start or what resources are available to them. This is where
HelpForAfricanAmericans, the largest directory of financial assistance programs
for African Americans, steps in to provide crucial support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HelpForAfricanAmericans operates an extensive database that
compiles information on financial aid opportunities for African Americans in
all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Through its website, users can access a
comprehensive list of programs offering support for various needs, including
help with groceries, rent, utility bills, college expenses, medical bills, and
more. The goal is to connect individuals with the resources that can provide
meaningful assistance during times of financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of the websiteâ€™s mission is accessibility. By
centralizing information on available financial aid programs, the directory
eliminates much of the guesswork and frustration that often accompanies the
search for assistance. Instead of combing through multiple sources, individuals
can quickly find relevant programs in their state, making it easier to apply
for the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directory covers a wide range of financial aid topics,
ensuring that people can find assistance tailored to their specific
circumstances. Programs listed include grants for home and car repairs, food
assistance, legal aid, childcare support, and help with medical expenses. There
are also resources for those seeking debt consolidation, foreclosure
prevention, and college scholarships. Additionally, specialized programs cater
to individuals with disabilities, seniors, and those facing unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most popular topics among users include rent
assistance, cash aid for those in need, support for purchasing a car or
computer, and help with groceries. These high-demand programs reflect the
common financial challenges faced by many African Americans and highlight the
organizationâ€™s commitment to addressing pressing concerns within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual financial assistance, the directory also
provides information on broader government welfare programs and nonprofit
organizations dedicated to supporting African Americans. Users can explore
options such as Section 8 housing assistance, food stamps, and state-specific
grants designed to alleviate financial burdens. The inclusion of these
resources ensures that individuals have a comprehensive understanding of the
aid available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The websiteâ€™s approach is rooted in empowerment. Equipping
people with knowledge about financial assistance programs enables them to make
informed decisions about their financial well-being. The platform also serves
as an educational resource, helping individuals understand eligibility
requirements, application processes, and the scope of available aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a directory of financial
assistance programs, HelpForAfricanAmericans actively works to keep its
information up to date. The landscape of financial aid is constantly evolving,
with new programs being introduced and existing ones undergoing changes.
Maintaining accurate and current information ensures that users can rely on the
directory as a trusted resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking financial relief, finding the right
assistance program can make a significant difference. Whether itâ€™s a grant for
college tuition, support for managing debt, or help covering medical expenses,
https://helpforafricanamericans.org/ simplifies the search process and connects
African Americans with the resources they need. With a commitment to
accessibility, accuracy, and comprehensive coverage, this financial assistance
directory plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between individuals in need
and the support systems designed to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About HelpforAfricanAmericans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Help for African Americans, the mission is to empower
and uplift the African American community by providing accessible resources,
vital information, and support for those in need. The platform works to bridge
gaps in healthcare, education, social justice, and economic opportunity by
fostering a nationwide network of information and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
