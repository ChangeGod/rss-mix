                            &lt;p&gt;Well there it is. Trump is talking like 10% is the floor, answering a big question in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Trump often says one thing and does another but that doesn&apos;t bode well for making many deals.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;147&quot; data-end=&quot;527&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is trading back to the downsideas sellers leaned early against key resistance levels (near 100 and 200 hour MA) and instead pushed toward a critical support zone. The price has now returned to a key support area between 1.1265 and 1.12754, a zone that previously acted as a springboard for upside moves. This level is once again being tested, and its ability to hold will be crucial for near-term directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;529&quot; data-end=&quot;778&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair remains below both the 100-hour moving average (currently near 1.1339) and the 200-hour moving average (near 1.1327), reinforcing the bearish tone. Over time, unless EURUSD can break back above those moving averages, sellers remain in control at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;780&quot; data-end=&quot;1079&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below 1.1265 would increase downside pressure and shift the focus toward the next major target at 1.12505, which corresponds to the 38.2% retracement of the 2024 rally. Further declines would expose support near 1.1200 to 1.1213 and 1.11509, where the 50% retracement level resides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1081&quot; data-end=&quot;1268&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For bulls to regain control, the price needs to move back above the 100/200-hour MAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1442&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support Levels:
• 1.1265–1.1275 = Key support zone
• 1.12505 = 38.2% retracement of 2024 move
• 1.1200–1.1213 = Swing area
• 1.11592 = 50% retracement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1444&quot; data-end=&quot;1572&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance Levels:
• 1.1327 = 100-hour MA
• 1.1339 = 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1579&quot; data-end=&quot;1653&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch for price action around 1.1265—this is the battleground for control.&lt;/p&gt;

How much though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, it could be. I mean, we&apos;re going to see. Right now, you can&apos;t get any higher -- it&apos;s at 145% -- so we know it&apos;s coming down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is not known for underselling. Here are some of the details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK has committed to fast-tracking US goods imports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreement increases access for beef and ethanol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK will reduce non-tariff barriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final details will be written up in the coming weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think China wants to make a deal very badly too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re going to be &apos;un-easing&apos; steel, want protections for steel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US-UK trade deal will eald to the creation of an aluminum and steel trading zone and a secure pharma supply chain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t much meat on these bones. Trump also turned some of the focus to China and added “I can tell you China very much wants to make a deal.  We’ll see how that works out”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starmer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deal will boost trade and create jobs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says the deal is &apos;a tribute to your leadership&apos; to Trump&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groveling from Starmer was really something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutnick is highlighting that the 10% tariff will remain and that the UK tariffs will raise $6 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK will announce it is going to buy $10 billion in Boeing planes today, won&apos;t name airline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutnick talked about creating a secure supply chain in things like steel and pharma. That could be a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Market Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market presents a mixed picture today, with notable performances in the consumer cyclical and communication services sectors. Giants like Tesla and Google are emerging as the day&apos;s winners, while the healthcare sector faces significant setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📈 Consumer Cyclical &amp; Communication Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla (TSLA) shines: Tesla has surged by 1.97%, showcasing strong investor confidence in the auto manufacturing sector as it continues to push innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon (AMZN) remains robust: With a gain of 0.81%, Amazon reflects positive sentiment in internet retail, possibly buoyed by recent consumer spending trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google (GOOG) leads in communication services: Google gains 1.64%, indicating resilient growth in internet content and information services. This uptick highlights investor optimism following strategic expansions within the sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏥 Healthcare Sector Woes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lilly (LLY) declines steeply: Lilly sees a sharp drop of 4.31%, contributing to the healthcare sector&apos;s struggles. This may be due to recent regulatory challenges or negative news affecting drug manufacturers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK): Both experience significant declines, down 1.79% and 1.32% respectively, reflecting broader concerns within pharmaceuticals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;💹 Financial Sector Resurgence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC): Both institutions post gains of over 1.43%, indicating a healthy recovery or investor pivot towards stable banking stocks amidst rising interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall Market Sentiment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market&apos;s mood today appears cautiously optimistic, driven by sector-specific dynamics rather than broad-based rallies. While tech and consumer companies appear to capture investor interest, the healthcare sector&apos;s downturn underscores existing vulnerabilities and market-specific news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investors should leverage the growth in consumer cyclical and tech sectors, considering potential rebounds or strategic announcements. Monitoring major players like Tesla and Google could yield opportunities as they capitalize on emerging trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given healthcare volatility, consider re-balancing exposure to diversify risk or capitalize on potential dips in firms with strong long-term fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay informed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for real-time updates and insights to navigate market dynamics effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, maintaining a diversified portfolio will be key in navigating today&apos;s mixed yet evolving marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Canada is out with its latest Financial Stability &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/05/financial-stability-report-2025/#Lower-interest-rates-are-easing-the-pressure-on-mortgage-holders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s mostly a risk-highlighting exercise that has little impact on financial markets but I do want to highlight one part of the report because I believe that housing market risks are mounting and prices are falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Among households with a mortgage, 60% are facing renewal this year or in
2026. Most of those renewing will see their payments rise because they took out
their mortgage during the pandemic when rates were very low. But the average
increase will be smaller than what we expected a year ago.
Still, if a large economic shock causes job losses, it will be harder for some
households to keep up with their debt payments.
A prolonged trade war may be that shock. It would cause demand for Canadian
exports to fall and disrupt supply chains, threatening jobs and incomes. Workers
in trade-dependent industries could find it particularly difficult to continue
managing their debt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers were released from the Toronto Real Estate Board yesterday and show sales down 23% y/y with listings up 54% y/y. The condo market is particularly dire but detached homes are cracking as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Space and Time Launches on Mainnet to Power a New Generation of Data-Driven Crypto Apps</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Space and Time, the
Microsoft-backed blockchain for zero-knowledge (ZK)-proven data, is live on its
public, permissionless mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time is designed to deliver ZK-proven data to
smart contracts to power a new generation of data-driven crypto applications.
It indexes data from other major blockchains, including Ethereum, and stores it
across a decentralized network of database validators. Developers can access,
query ZK-prove and connect this data back to their smart contract using Proof
of SQL, Space and Time’s sub-second ZK coprocessor for SQL database queries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prior to Space and Time, onchain applications had no way
to query basic user data from a database of blockchain activity without
introducing security risks and tampering. In addition, enterprises had no way
to securely connect their cloud databases with smart contracts. Today we’re
thrilled to announce the mainnet launch of Space and Time, which will empower
developers to build sophisticated, data-driven onchain applications secured by
cryptographic proofs,” said Scott Dykstra, Contributor #001 at Space and
Time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts today can’t natively access historical,
cross-chain or offchain data, which limits the complexity of onchain apps.
Chainlink pioneered external data access for smart contracts with secure
oracles and cross-chain messaging, solving key pieces of the context problem.
The next wave of onchain innovation—spanning everything from dynamic financial
instruments to data-rich AI agents and tokenized real-world systems—will
require a trustless database layer for complex data retrieval. Space and Time enables
this with a verifiable, decentralized database network that gives smart
contracts the ability to query the full history of Ethereum and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smart contracts need context to make decisions, whether
it’s real-time market data, cross-chain messaging or historical onchain
activity. Chainlink provides the connective tissue for data to move securely
across systems, and Space and Time brings powerful new compute capabilities
that complement that vision. Together, we’re pushing the boundaries of what
developers can build onchain,” said Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time was created by MakeInfinite Labs, a frontier
protocol research lab that is backed by Microsoft and working alongside major
financial institutions. In addition to its work on Space and Time, the firm has
developed key technologies to the broader crypto ecosystem, such as Proof of
SQL, Blitzar, an Elastic Network ZK Chain for Space and Time, and Chainlink
DeFi Yield Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MakeInfinite Labs, we’re focused on building
foundational infrastructure to enable the next generation of crypto
applications. Contributing core technologies like Proof of SQL and the original
architecture of Space and Time is part of that vision. We’re excited to see the
ecosystem take this work forward and unlock new possibilities for verifiable,
data-driven applications,” said Nate Holiday, CEO of MakeInfinite Labs &amp;amp;
Co-Founder of Space and Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time is secured by a decentralized set of
validators, and anyone can contribute to the network by providing high-quality
datasets, staking or running a validator node. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Space and Time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time (https://www.spaceandtime.io) is the
blockchain for ZK-proven data, which enables smart contracts to trustlessly
access and compute over data from any chain or source. Powered by Proof of SQL,
a sub-second ZK coprocessor, Space and Time empowers developers to build more
intelligent, data-rich applications with verifiable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About MakeInfinite Labs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakeInfinite Labs is a frontier protocol research lab
contributing to some of the most prominent protocols and ecosystems across
crypto, including the creation of Space and Time. MakeInfinite Labs raised $50
million from Microsoft’s M12 Ventures and other leading investors to build the
infrastructure that enables developers and creators to build data-driven
applications, tokenize and monetize and win in the AI economy.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Report from the Telegraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will be part of a 12-month temporary deal ahead of what sides hope is a comprehensive deal &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will cut beef tariffs close to zero&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff on UK steel exports will also be lowered, but rate not finalized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is running late but it looks like these are the important parts. It&apos;s not much of a deal but it does leave room to negotiate away the 10% in a comprehensive deal. You&apos;d have to think the UK thinks they can get there or they wouldn&apos;t be taking down barriers but we&apos;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;176&quot; data-end=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD  moved lower yesterday and moved back below the 200 day MA (currently at 0.64608) and the rising 100 hour MA (blue line currently at the same 0.64608 level).  The fall stalled near the 200 hour MA into the close and rebounced in the early Asian Pacific session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;176&quot; data-end=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price move higher earlier in the day stalled near a dual resistance zone, defined by the 100-hour moving average and the 200-day moving average, both converging near 0.64608. That rejection marked a turning point, as the price quickly rotated lower, breaking below the 200-hour moving average at 0.6430—a short-term bearish shift. The price also reentered into a Red Box consolidation area that defined the trading range going back to mid-April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;875&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Selling momentum carried the pair down toward the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, located at 0.6408, where support buyers stepped in, temporarily halting the decline. The bounce that followed has brought the price back toward the 200-hour MA, now acting as the close resistance level. The high of the Red Box extends up to 0.64419.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;877&quot; data-end=&quot;1213&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sellers are making a play back below the 200 day moving average, the 100 hour moving average, and back within the Red Box and the 200 hour moving average. The buying break to the upside earlier this week is fizzling out a bit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;877&quot; data-end=&quot;1213&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Going forward, if price breaks and stays below 0.6408, it would open the door for a deeper correction toward the next lower swing area and the 200-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, currently near 0.6318.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1220&quot; data-end=&quot;1245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1334&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1334&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:
• 0.64608 = 100-hour MA / 200-day MA
• 0.6430 = 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1336&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:
• 0.6408 = 100-bar MA on 4-hour chart
• 0.63437 = lower swing area
• 0.6318 = 200-bar MA on 4-hour chart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1476&quot; data-end=&quot;1609&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers will look for a sustained break below 0.6408 to add confidence, while buyers need a move back above 0.6460 to regain control.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The source here is &apos;Wall Street Execs&apos; so take it with a grain of salt but this isn&apos;t a good sign:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BREAKING: Wall Street execs with contracts in the White House say the plan for trade deals on tap — India, Japan, South Korea and Australia— is to have tariffs at or around 10 per like UK. China, of course, is another story. Developing&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t seem many countries offering up concessions for the privilege of exporting with 10% tariffs. If anything, others are likely to retaliate. This helps to explain why progress with Japan quickly fell apart and why Trump is now looking to dictate trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not a good sign but it&apos;s also not clear if Congress will tolerate it for the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something we sniffed out at the beginning: That the high &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariffs were some kind of opening-bid smokescreen to get countries to accept 10%. We&apos;ll have to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;792&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD is moving higher after a week or so of gradually lower lows, all of which were quickly reversed, signaling that sellers lacked conviction (see lows on the chart above). That dynamic shifted more definitively after the FOMC rate decision, which fueled broad USD buying and helped push the pair above the 100- and 200-hour moving averages. Those MAs, now sitting at 1.38107 and 1.38313, were retested earlier today when a modest dip found buyers—a bullish signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;794&quot; data-end=&quot;1371&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With momentum building, the price has now reached a key ceiling area from April between 1.38917 and 1.3904. This zone had acted as the high of the range for nearly two weeks and now serves as a major technical barrier. A break above 1.3904 would open the door toward the next resistance zone between 1.3924 and 1.3933. Above that, the April 15 high at 1.3977 becomes the next upside target, followed by a confluence of resistance near 1.4000, which includes the 38.2% retracement of the April drop (at 1.4003) and the 200-day moving average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support:
• 1.3860 = Highs from last Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.3810 to 1.3821 = 100/200 hour MAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1446&quot; data-end=&quot;1609&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:
• 1.38917–1.3904 = April ceiling
• 1.3924–1.3933 = Swing area
• 1.3977 = April 15 high
• 1.4000–1.4003 = Psych level / 38.2% / 200-day MA&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The market is waiting for the announcement of a UK-US trade deal at 10 am ET but the details so far leaving the market disappointed. The UK FTSE 100 has fallen into negative territory after earlier trading higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-us-uk-trade-pact-will-leave-the-10-tariff-in-place-report-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;from CNN indicated this is a vague &apos;deal&apos; that leaves on the 10% US tariffs on broader goods and focuses on steel and autos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTSE has been sliding since the report hit 30 minutes ago and is now into negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This take adds up for me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also out from Robert Peston from ITV:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;today’s agreement between the UK and US is principally about cuts to Trump’s 25% tariff on £10bn of UK car exports to US and £3bn of steel and aluminium exports.  I assume it will come down to Trump’s baseline global 10% tariff. A wider more ambitious UK/US trade agreement is still months  years away.  For these initial tariff reductions, Starmer is NOT cutting or scrapping the Digital Services Tax, which raises £800m per annum from the likes of Amazon, Meta and Google - but that tax is likely to be in play during the next round of negotiations&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;78&quot; data-end=&quot;405&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to consolidate between clearly defined range extremes with resistance near 0.8333 and support at 0.81952. Yesterday’s price action briefly pushed below that lower boundary, reaching a low of 0.8185 during the FOMC-related volatility, but buyers quickly stepped in, rejecting the downside break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;407&quot; data-end=&quot;644&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Currently, the pair is rotating around its 100- and 200-hour moving averages, which are clustered mid-range between 0.82395 (100-hour MA) and 0.82484 (200-hour MA). That positioning reflects a neutral, indecisive market bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;646&quot; data-end=&quot;703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;To shift the technical outlook, traders will be watching:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;704&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;704&quot; data-end=&quot;760&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;706&quot; data-end=&quot;760&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above 0.8333 to increase bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;761&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back below 0.81952 to reignite downside pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;761&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100 and 200 hour MA midrange (0.82395 to 0.82484) are barometers for more bullish or more bearish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;825&quot; data-end=&quot;920&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the pair remains caught in a range as buyers and sellers battle for near-term control.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This is a bad sign for hopes that we could get back to 0%. It indicates that 10% is a floor and I don&apos;t think many countries are going to go for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the White House CNN reporter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Trump’s trade announcement with the UK will be limited in scope, heavy on future commitments &amp;amp; leave the existing 10% universal tariffs in place, a US &amp;amp; UK official tell Phil Mattingly [a fellow CNN reporter]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An optimist might hope that as some of those &apos;future commitments&apos; are met there is a path to removing the 10% so let&apos;s wait and see. But I just can&apos;t see major US trading partners rolling over on a deal like this. The UK is around 2.5% of US imports so it&apos;s not a big trading relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate report from the FT says this deal is initially focused on autos and steel. That matches&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-and-uk-close-to-trade-agreement-report-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; initial reporting&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that this deal is more about those two sets of tariffs than the 10% &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariff policy.&lt;/p&gt;

New York showed a 15K increase which was a outlier that caused the spike to 241K last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending April 26 were in New York (+15,418), Massachusetts
(+3,301), Georgia (+1,207), Puerto Rico (+1,012), and Nebraska (+570), while the largest decreases were in Connecticut
(-2,340), Rhode Island (-1,850), Missouri (-1,696), Michigan (-1,436), and Washington (-700).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jobs situation remains solid which keeps the Fed on hold.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Most of the market&apos;s focus will be on today&apos;s initial jobless claims report at the bottom of the hour (along with Q1 productivity data) but the report I&apos;m watching for is the March wholesale inventory report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus is for a 0.5% rise but I&apos;m looking for a higher number or a revision higher in the February data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US GDP fell on a surge in imports but those imports haven&apos;t appeared in inventories despite data like this chart, which shows imports of roughly two years worth of metals products ahead of steel/aluminum tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK confirmed that Trump&apos;s announcement later is to be an agreement for a trade deal, or at least the framework of one, and that sets the stage ahead of the 1400 GMT showing at the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Trump also got up and early to keep risk sentiment underpinned as he says that the agreement will be a &quot;full and comprehensive one&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, as things stand, media reports don&apos;t seem to have much of anything to show for. So, we&apos;ll see if Trump will deliver any major details in his announcement later. The only thing so far that we know is that the UK is looking to make concessions on food and agriculture in exchange for lower auto tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;US futures and European indices are staying buoyed as a result while in FX, the dollar held steadier earlier on but gave back some gains during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;EUR/USD fell to a low of 1.1270 early in the day but is now sticking just above 1.1300 with large option expiries at the figure level also perhaps attracting price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, USD/JPY is marked higher throughout with a push towards 145.00 as bond yields are also keeping up on the day. Besides that, USD/CHF is up 0.1% to 0.8245 but off earlier highs of 0.8290 and USD/CAD up slightly by 0.3% to 1.3885 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The pound was a decent mover late on as the BOE cut the bank rate by 25 bps to 4.25% as expected. However, it was the bank rate vote decision that raised eyebrows with two members voting to keep rates unchanged. That is seeing the decision being viewed as more of a hawkish rate cut and sterling jumped as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;GBP/USD moved up from 1.3250 to 1.3330 and is holding at the highs now as we look towards US trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Looking to the day ahead, the main focus will be on Trump&apos;s announcement later as that will set the tone for broader markets ahead of the weekend. As a reminder, there&apos;s also still talks with China due in Switzerland during the two-day break. So, that will be an important consideration for traders to consider in their approach going into next week.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;108&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank of England cut rates by 25 basis points, sending GBPUSD initially lower to the session’s low and briefly breaking below the recent support floor near 1.1254—an area that had held over the past week. However, the move quickly reversed as traders digested the mixed vote, which included dissenters on both sides of the consensus cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;945&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound took the pair back toward the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, currently between 1.33137 and 1.33335. So far, the rally has stalled in that area. A sustained move above the 200-hour MA would be needed to shift the technical bias more convincingly in favor of the buyers. It’s worth noting that the pair briefly traded above these levels on Tuesday and again attempted to hold above them yesterday, but upside momentum faded—helped in part by a post-FOMC rebound in the US dollar. PS Trump announced that a trade deal with the UK (the UK is the 7th largest trading partner with the US). PSS Trump tweets that Too Late Powell is a fool..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EURUSD is starting the US session modestly lower after testing key support between 1.12657 and 1.12754. The low price reached 1.12696.  On the topside the 100 and 200 hour MAs will be topside resistance between 1.13289 and 1.13404.  Like the GBPUSD, the price this week has moved above those MAs, but stalled.  Watching 1.12657 on the downside and 1.13404 on the topside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDJPY is pushing higher after breaking above the 100 hour MA (currently at 143.743) and the 38.2% retracement at 144.208.  On the topside the falling 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 145.184 is the next key target on more upside momentum. Recall from last week, the price stalled the high for the week at that MA level and that started the fall (from 145.87) to the low reached on Tuesday (at 142.35). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are higher to start the day helped by trade-deal hope. Pres. Trump also said he would ease chip constraints which has the likes of Nvidia and Broadcom trading higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the major indices, the futures are implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average is up 329 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P Index is up 54 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq index is up 265 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.822%, +2.9 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield 3.908%, +3.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.298%, +2.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year year 4.78%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;in other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading up $1.04 or 1.79% of $59.12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading down $18 or -0.54% at $3347.94&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up $2349 and $99,403&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus will be on initial jobless claims which spiked up to 241K last week.  Is it the start of a trend or just a glitch from Easter or some other weird seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The EU is deeming this to be a part of a &quot;mutually beneficial and balanced solution&quot; as both sides are seeking negotiations on trade. The €95 billion will cover a broad range of industrial and agricultural products. And adding to that, the EU is also seeking possible restrictions on certain exports of steel scrap and chemical products to the US worth €4.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;At the same time, the EU will launch a WTO dispute against the US on both reciprocal and auto tariffs for what it&apos;s worth. The full list of the targeted €95 billion worth of countermeasures can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/e9d50ad8-e41f-4379-839a-fdfe08f0aa96/library/fd09c397-b621-4dcd-be36-1684eb37e3fb/details?download=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
