                            &lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of New Zealand survey  for Q2 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-year ahead inflation expectation 2.41%, prior 2.15%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year ahead inflation expectation 2.3% (prior 2.1%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&apos;s economy is in need of further rate cuts but the RBNZ will not like inflation expectations edging higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand dollar higher also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke about this data point earlier today and what it might mean for the kiwi $. ICYMI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RBNZ conducts quarterly surveys to gauge inflation expectations among business leaders and professional forecasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three quarters, the surveys indicate a general decline in both 1-year and 2-year ahead inflation expectations, suggesting that inflation is expected to move closer to the RBNZ&apos;s target band of 1–3%. The slight uptick in the 1-year expectation in Q1 2025 may reflect short-term factors, but the 2-year expectation continued its downward trend, indicating confidence in medium-term price stability. It&apos;s the two-year period that the RBNZ focuses on most in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1 2025 (Survey conducted in January 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;306&quot; data-end=&quot;548&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;306&quot; data-end=&quot;387&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;308&quot; data-end=&quot;387&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1-year ahead inflation expectation: Increased to 2.15% from 2.05% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;388&quot; data-end=&quot;548&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;390&quot; data-end=&quot;548&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;2-year ahead inflation expectation: Decreased to 2.06% from 2.12% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4 2024 (Survey conducted in October 2024)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;602&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;602&quot; data-end=&quot;683&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;604&quot; data-end=&quot;683&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1-year ahead inflation expectation: Decreased to 2.05% from 2.40% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;686&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;2-year ahead inflation expectation: Increased to 2.12% from 2.03% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3 2024 (Survey conducted in July 2024)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;895&quot; data-end=&quot;1137&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;895&quot; data-end=&quot;976&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;897&quot; data-end=&quot;976&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1-year ahead inflation expectation: Decreased to 2.40% from 2.73% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;1137&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;979&quot; data-end=&quot;1137&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;2-year ahead inflation expectation: Decreased to 2.03% from 2.33% in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RBNZ closely monitors these expectations to inform its monetary policy stance. The decline in medium-term expectations aligns with the central bank&apos;s goal of maintaining inflation within its target range, potentially allowing for more accommodative monetary policy if the trend continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An upside move for the two-year should support the NZD, at the margin.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;South Korea&apos;s  Ministry of Economy and Finance monthly economic report, the Green Book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;economy is facing &quot;increasing&quot; downward pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;due largely to a slowdown in exports amid lingering trade uncertainties and a decline in domestic consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth consecutive month the Ministry has made such an assessment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&quot;The economy is facing growing downward pressure, as the recovery in domestic demand remains sluggish and job market difficulties persist, particularly in vulnerable sectors. External conditions have worsen due to U.S. tariff policies, leading to a slowdown in exports&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Arizona also passed a similar law&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as more US states rule to invest in Bitcoin, it could act as a “sustained positive” catalyst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can track this call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/LiveCharts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;using our free charts&lt;/a&gt;, here is BTC/XAU: &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;176&quot; data-end=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports jumped 12.4% in April compared to a year earlier, far exceeding expectations and marking a sharp acceleration from March’s 5.4% rise. The latest figures, released Friday by Enterprise Singapore, showed strong gains across both electronic and non-electronic shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;482&quot; data-end=&quot;750&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result came well above the 4.3% year-on-year increase forecast in a Reuters poll and reflected solid demand from key trading partners including the U.S., Japan, and regional economies such as Taiwan and South Korea. However, exports to China and Malaysia declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;752&quot; data-end=&quot;1267&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the upside surprise, the broader outlook remains clouded by escalating global trade tensions, particularly in light of new tariffs imposed by the United States. Singapore, whose economy is heavily reliant on external trade, has been flagged as vulnerable to a global slowdown. In response, the government recently formed an economic resilience taskforce and warned that a recession cannot be ruled out. Last month, it revised its full-year GDP forecast down to a range of 0% to 2%, from a previous 1% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

expectations. We&apos;re expecting the cash rate will go to 3.35%
now. That shift was really a rough lesson of a very changing,
uncertain global environment where global growth was likely to
slow,&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;There are indications some of those tariff announcements
are going to be wound back but the big question is how this
actually shakes consumer confidence and how businesses are
feeling... There is some clear softness in the business
environment, which would support a rate cut from the RBA next
week.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;HSBC argue for further yen recovery vs the USD citing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;heightened U.S. policy uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;resumption of pessimism toward the U.S. economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;renewed expectations of Fed easing soon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC are tracking trade developments, noting market sensitivity &quot;to headlines about U.S.-Japan trade talks, especially regarding FX discussions” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC’s modelling indicates 141-149 range for USD/JPY, though analysts do recognise risks for both overshooting and undershooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stuck in lines around 141 and 149, just using eyeballing ... it looks like we don&apos;t have to worry about over and undershooting those levels for a while to come yet. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A piece in today&apos;s Australian Financial Review on Australia not joining in on Trump&apos;s trade attack on China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade Minister Don Farrell spoke in an interview with the AFR (gated): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reluctant to be part of a US campaign
against China on trade, given that Australian exports to China are worth almost 10 times that to the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“China is our
largest trading partner. Chinese trade is almost 10 times more
valuable to Australia”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don’t want to do less business
with China, we want to do more business with China.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

We’ll make
decisions about how we continue to engage with China based on our
national interests and not on what the Americans may or may not
want.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AFR is gated, here is the link if you can access it for much more. &lt;/p&gt;
