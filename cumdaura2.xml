                            &lt;p&gt;Bessent is out saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Believes the debt to GDP ratio will drop next year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key word is &quot;believes&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has been focused on cutting costs and reducing the government deficits. DOGE efforts which were at first targeting $2T of cuts has been slashed to $1T and lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of May 2025, the DOGE, led by Elon Musk under the Trump administration, reports achieving approximately $160 billion in federal spending cuts. These reductions stem from various measures, including workforce downsizing, contract terminations, and program eliminations.  However, it is still unsure how much the government has saved given other costs from the cuts including severance costs and other intangible costs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pres. Trump sees tariffs as a way to add more to the Treasury as well and reduce debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;When there is a revolution, there are a lot of uncertainties. The comment that the Treasury Secretary &quot;believes&quot;, inserts an element of uncertainty from the revolutionary changes that are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bessent adds ahead of the Fed decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fed should focus on both price and employment goals. Inflation and employment are in inexorably linked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs for items that parents need to care for their children are under consideration.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;132&quot; data-end=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple’s SVP of Services, Eddy Cue, revealed that search and browser usage declined for the first time in April. In response, Apple is reportedly exploring the integration of AI-powered search capabilities into its browsers—a potential shift that poses a direct threat to Alphabet, which benefits from a lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Apple for default Google searches on iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alphabet shares are taking a major hit on the news, falling $-13.65 or -8.41% at $149.50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the initial selloff pushed the stock back below its 50-day moving average at $160.66, and more importantly, below the 38.2% retracement of the rally from the November 2022 low ($83.34) to the February 2025 high ($207.05) at $159.79. From its peak, Alphabet is now down 27.5%, and it has lost 20.71% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;930&quot; data-end=&quot;1053&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the stock remains above the 2025 low of $140.53 (set on April 7), the next technical support levels to watch are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$147.22 – swing low from September 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1100&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1102&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$145.20 – 50% retracement of the Nov 2022–Feb 2025 rally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is room to roam to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sharp move underscores growing investor concern as AI alternatives like ChatGPT continue to disrupt traditional search behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a day of reckoning for Alphabet. They need to evolve. They will not go away but the cash cow is hurting and the data seems to be supporting it.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, AUDUSD briefly pushed above the 0.6504 swing high from early December 2024, but the breakout failed to gain traction, and the pair has since reversed lower (see 4-hour chart above). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inability to hold above that key resistance level suggests buyers lacked the momentum to drive the next leg higher and has helped lead to more selling today from a technical perspective.  .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;698&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the pair is trading lower and retesting the 200-day moving average 9higher green line on the chart below), currently at 0.6460. A break below that level and the 100-hour MA at 0.6452, would open the door for a look toward the 200-hour MA at 0.6428 coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;700&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is also a swing area between 0.6429 and 0.6442 will be key for determining short-term direction. Holding this zone could offer buyers a base for another attempt higher. A break below, however, would shift the bias more clearly in favor of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;963&quot; data-end=&quot;987&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6504 (failed breakout zone), 0.6514 (new high for 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1036&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1038&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.6460 (200-day MA), 0.6452 (100-hour MA), 0.6428 (200-hour MA), 0.6429–0.6442 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Apple VP of services Eddie Cue is saying that Apple is exploring adding AI to search browsers. The comments seem to have turned the stock market. The NASDAQ is now down around -59 points or -0.33% at 17631. The S&amp;amp;P is also dipping into negative territory..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google have been impacted by the announcement. It&apos;s shares are down -$7.61 or -4.5% to $156.00. Microsoft shares are down -1 dollar or -0.25% to $432.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple pays Google a fee every time a user clicks on Google. Hence the decline in Google shares. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ is reporting that tariffs could lift laptop and phone prices by some 30% according to some forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know.... Rising prices by 30% is still a threat to cost-push inflationinfluences.  The line that inflation from tariffs will only be a one time price increase may not be that.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a vibrant rally, particularly in the consumer cyclical sector, with Amazon (AMZN) leading the way with an impressive gain of 3.11%. The sector showcases robust investor sentiment, driven by optimistic forecasts and strong consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the technology sector shows moderate yet consistent gains, with Microsoft (MSFT) up by 0.46%, highlighting steady confidence in tech-driven growth. On the flip side, the energy sector faces challenges, as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) both post a decline of 0.53%, reflecting ongoing volatility in oil and gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market mood is cautiously optimistic, with significant gains in consumer and tech stocks mitigating losses in more volatile sectors like energy and industrials. Investors appear to be capitalizing on consumer cyclical opportunities, while tech&apos;s consistent performance suggests long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, healthcare shows modest growth with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) up 0.30%, indicating sustained interest in defensive plays amid market fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the current market dynamics, investors might consider reinforcing their portfolios with strong consumer cyclical and tech stocks to leverage the ongoing rally. AMZN and TSLA, showing gains of 3.11% and 0.43% respectively, could be beneficial additions for those eyeing potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, caution is advised regarding energy stocks, as ongoing global concerns may continue to exert downward pressure. Investors should stay informed with evolving market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, today&apos;s market landscape offers diverse opportunities, bolstered by consumer confidence and tech stability. Staying abreast of real-time market data on ForexLive.com will equip investors to navigate these dynamic conditions effectively. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil inventories -2.032 million versus estimate -0.833 million. The private API data released late yesterday showed a draw of -4.49 million &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasoline inventories build  of +0.188 million versus drawdown of -1.600 million estimate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distillates inventories draw of-1.107 million versus estimate of -1.271 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are the weekly API inventory data released late yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil is trading down $0.46 at $58.62. The high price today reached $60.22. The low price is at $58.59. Looking at the hourly chart, the price is approaching its rising 100 hour moving average of $58.26. Earlier today, the price moved above its 200-hour moving average (green line in the chart below) currently at $59.70. It also extended about the 50% midpoint of the move down from the April 23 high. That level comes in at $60.08. However, momentum about the 50% midpoint level and the natural resistance at $60, faded fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

Until then, sellers remain in control, and downside probes into the lower support zone remain a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices are trading higher in early US trading. The gains were helped by the US/China meeting news, but the levels are lower than premarket levels implied by the futures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow industrial average is leading the way with a gain of 0.56%. The S&amp;amp;P index is up 0.47% and the NASDAQ index is up 0.40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Bessent will be speaking on Capitol Hill. His comments are expected to begin very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices remain just above their rising 50 hour moving average. For the S&amp;amp;P index the 50 arm of which is at 5596.31. The low price today raised 5613.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the NASDAQ index it&apos;s 50 hour moving averages at 17622.12. They low price reached 17689.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the indices also held above the moving average which increases the levels importance from a technical perspective. If there is a break look for momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Time is ticking, but the tariff war remains unclear with
Donald Trump suddenly declaring that he does not plan to talk to Xi Jinping
this week, and adding that China is “stealing” from the U.S. In short, there is
still no trade deal in sight between the two world powers, which is not good
news for markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the US rejected Japan&apos;s request to lift
tariffs altogether, a move that did not please investors either. As a result,
both the Nasdaq and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SPX/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P
500 started the week in the red&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly expected
reaction. Who knows, we may see another rally in Treasury yields if the deal
fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, however, markets have followed a similar
pattern: an initial wave of pessimism followed by a rebound. Some see this as
reminiscent of the Biden era. The problem is that back then, investors were
pinning their hopes on the next interest rate cut, which now seems less likely
as inflation risks increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the “buy the dips” approach last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start by remembering that past performance does not
guarantee future results. Therefore, expecting the rally to continue just
because it has happened in the past is a risky bet. Moreover, analysts don&apos;t
seem too confident that recent gains will be sustained, as trade wars have
already hurt the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not just the drop in GDP in the first quarter, caused
mainly by a widening trade deficit due to increased imports by businesses
before tariffs went into effect, but the fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-plunges-april-2025-04-29/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20April%2029%20(Reuters),lowest%20reading%20since%20May%202020.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;U.S.
consumer confidence index fell&lt;/a&gt; to 86.0 in April from
93.9 previously. The current situation index also fell to 133.5 from 134.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the U.S. S&amp;amp;P Global Composite PMI index fell to
50.6 in April from 53.5 in March, its lowest reading since September 2023.
Business expectations fell to their lowest level in two and a half years, and
employment numbers were virtually flat. Not surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;XAUUSD is returning to an uptrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this increasingly points to a slowdown in the
economic cycle, and worse, it may be accompanied by a pickup in inflation due
to tariffs. This would likely push the Fed to adopt a more aggressive monetary
policy. In the short term, this should raise doubts about current market
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing: macroeconomic uncertainty makes it
difficult for companies to provide clear guidance. Take Tesla, for example. In
its latest earnings report, the company declined to give a full-year outlook,
saying it would wait until second-quarter results to update investors, and
money doesn&apos;t like unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the bottom line? Keep your eyes open and be prepared
for possible turnarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;VP Vance is speaking and says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security posture of last 20 years is not adequate for the next 20 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think Russians are asking for too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would like Russians and Ukrainians to agree to guidelines for talking to each other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a big gulf between where Ukrainians and Russians are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably impossible to mediate this without at least some direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No conversation between US and China about a strategic deal of Taiwan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think China will have to let their population consume more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open to having conversations with friends and more adversarial national about rebalancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think we can do that while preserving dialogue with China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversations are ongoing with EU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We want European markets to be open to American goods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think we can have a better trading relationship with your pants if they would drop trade barriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think there is a deal that would reintegrate Iran into global economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would be open to sitting down with Russia and China to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far so good on negotiations with Iran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iran can have civil nuclear power&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump thinks goal should be 5% spending on defense and NATO&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments - as presented - are different in that they seem not to be &quot;Pres Trump wants&quot; but &quot;We think&quot;. A lot of the times, the members of the administration preface most comments with &quot;The President wants to...&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just an interesting shift which I may be overempasizing, but....&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is reporting that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU is to announce provisional list of tariffs against the US on Thursday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU tariffs to be enforced if talks with the US fail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headlines mirror an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/eu-reportedly-eyes-tariffs-on-boeing-if-trade-talks-with-us-go-south-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;earlier report &lt;/a&gt;that indicated the EU is reportedly preparing a list of roughly €100 billion in annual U.S. imports—including Boeing aircraft—that could face tariffs if trade negotiations with the U.S. break down. While the move is seen as potential retaliation for ongoing U.S. tariffs, any measures would still require approval from EU member states. The proposed list is expected to be circulated within the next day but remains subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;104&quot; data-end=&quot;328&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the past six trading days, USDCAD has followed a pattern of making new lows every other day—last Wednesday, last Friday, and again yesterday (Tuesday). If that pattern continues, it would suggest that today will not see a new low. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;330&quot; data-end=&quot;539&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, each of these new lows has been quickly reversed, indicating a negative bias but lacking strong downside momentum. Notably, the recent lows mark the weakest levels for USDCAD since October 2024, yet momentum has not been strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;541&quot; data-end=&quot;877&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, each rebound following a low—Thursday and again on Monday—has managed to push the pair above both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, even if only briefly. However, today’s rebound from yesterday’s low has so far stalled below the 100-hour moving average at 1.38095. The 200-hour moving average sits above at 1.38251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For bullish momentum to build, the price will need to break back above both of those key moving averages, and stay above those moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fundamentally, Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, met with former President Trump and described the discussions as productive. However, Carney firmly stated that “Canada is not for sale” and highlighted concerns regarding the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from Canada’s perspective. He also emphasized Canada’s intent to diversify its trade relationships beyond North America. In response to these developments, the Canadian dollar has weakened, putting upward pressure on USDCAD - of late.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Will that bias end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get and stay above the 100/200 hour MAs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The economic calendar in the North American session is void of economic releases. The only release will be by the EE IA with their weekly while inventory data. The expectations are for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil -0.833M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasoline -1.6000M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distilates -1.271M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private data released late yesterday showed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the Fed, the decision will be announced at 2 PM ET with the press conference starting at 2:30 PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;385&quot; data-end=&quot;440&quot;&gt;No rate change expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;445&quot; data-end=&quot;548&quot;&gt;Balance sheet policy also likely to remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus will be on forward guidance and the Fed&apos;s data-dependent posture amid policy uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions will likely center on the expectations for policy given the tariffs and its potential impact on growth/inflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;79&quot; data-end=&quot;335&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fed Chair Powell has remained committed to a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach, relying on incoming data before making any policy shifts. So far, that strategy has worked, as hard data continues to hold up. However, the full impact of new tariffs has yet to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;337&quot; data-end=&quot;625&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As time passes without resolution, companies will be forced to make pricing decisions, and supply chains could face renewed strain. While employment trends may help absorb some inflationary pressure, broader effects may begin to surface. The U.S. economy is a complex mix of moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;627&quot; data-end=&quot;822&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the job market remains resilient—this week’s initial jobless claims data will be closely watched. While soft data continues to show weakness, the hard data still paints a stable picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing in a 30% chance for a cut at the June meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury auctioned off three notes on Monday and 10 year notes on Tuesday. Both were met with pretty decent demand. Today, they will refrain from auctioning off the 30-year bonds to stay away from the FOMC rate decision volatility.  The 30 year bonds will be auctioned off tomorrow at 1 PM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer credit will also be released at 3 PM this afternoon with expectations of $9.50 billion increase versus the modest -0.81 billion decrease last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are modestly higher  in premarket trading as the market reacts positively to the US/China trade talks. The features are employing a 19.34 point rise in the S&amp;amp;P. Yields are higher in the short end with the two-year up 2.5 basis points. The 30-year bond is down -1.9 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is higher vs the 3 major currency pairs to start the US session (by differing amounts of course). Overnight, it was announced that the US and China would meet in Switzerland to break the ice on trade.  It is a step in the right direction but as many have stressed, the negotiations with China will be drawn out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Reserve will meet today and announce no change in rates. The focus will be on what Fed Chair Powell says and the FOMC statement. There will be no central tendencies or dot plots. For the June meeting, the market is pricing in around a 30% chance of a cut of 25 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stocks are higher in reaction after two days of declines to start the trading week.  US yields are modestly higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video below looks at the technicals that are driving the 3 major currency pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the US stock market is showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial Average  up 264 points after falling -389 points or -0.95%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P up 32 points after falling -43.47 points or -0.77% yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq index up 115 points after falling -154.58 points or -0.87% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, the yields are higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.815% +2.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.920%, +2.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.323%, +0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.801%, -1.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil and is up $0.60 or 1.03% at $59.70&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is rotating back to the downside by -$48 or -1.42% at $3388.70&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver is trading down $0.26 or -0.83% at $32.91&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up $173 and $96,987&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The headlines overnight helped to give US futures a bump as well as the dollar. And that mostly stayed the course in European morning trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The greenback did give back some of its gains though, with EUR/USD turning back to near flat levels at 1.1363 currently. USD/JPY was one that held up, easing a little to 142.90 before coming back up to 143.33 at the moment. Besides that, USD/CAD is up 0.1% to 1.3793 and AUD/USD down 0.3% to 0.6470 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Overall, it&apos;s not much but at least a minor victory for the dollar - for now anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for US futures, the gains mostly held with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures seen up 0.6%. That&apos;s off the earlier high of gains of a little over 1% though, with market players keeping more tentative as China reaffirmed that their position hasn&apos;t changed ahead of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;European indices were less enthused though, as we&apos;re yet to see much of any progress in talks between the EU and US at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is down as the risk mood is holding up with the precious metal easing back under $3,400 on the day. Meanwhile, oil is also marked higher amid the better trade news as WTI crude tests the $60 mark during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Coming up, we&apos;ll have to navigate through more trade headlines but there is also the FOMC meeting decision to scrutinise. How will Trump respond when the Fed decides to keep rates unchanged later? We&apos;ll have to see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons in Patience and Adaptability from EBC’s Trading Challenge II, Week 9</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/lessons-in-patience-and-adaptability-from-ebcs-trading-challenge-ii-week-9-20250507/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 11:30:16 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/lessons-in-patience-and-adaptability-from-ebcs-trading-challenge-ii-week-9-20250507/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;At EBC Financial Group, we see firsthand how rapidly
evolving markets test the resolve and skill of traders. Week 9 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot;&gt;EBC’s Million Dollar Trading Challenge II&lt;/a&gt;
was a vivid example: gold and forex pairs swung sharply, leaderboards shifted
overnight, and traders faced a landscape where yesterday’s strategies no longer
guaranteed tomorrow’s results. In such an environment, three qualities stand
out as essential for success: adaptability, strategic patience, and the power
of community-driven trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptability: Thriving Amid Uncertainty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatility is a double-edged sword. It creates risk but also
opens the door to opportunity for those who can adapt quickly. Our top
performers in Week 9-like @forexwatchbrother and @willsdad-did not cling to a single
approach. Instead, they shifted between gold and key currency pairs,
capitalising on reversals and adjusting their tactics as conditions changed. This
willingness to pivot is what separates resilient traders from those who are
left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Patience: Knowing When to Act-and When to Wait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fast-moving market, it’s tempting to chase every swing.
Yet, as @songqiantongzi demonstrated, sometimes the wisest move is to wait for
the right opportunity. Strategic patience is not about inaction; it’s about
discipline-knowing when to step back and when to strike. This approach
preserves capital, reduces emotional trading, and positions traders to make the
most of high-conviction setups when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-Driven Trading: Learning and Growing Together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful development in today’s trading
landscape is the rise of community-driven platforms like EBC’s zero-fee copy
trading. By enabling traders to replicate the strategies of top performers in
real time, we lower the barrier to entry and democratise access to proven
expertise. Our five-dimensional signal rating system and transparent
performance dashboards empower both new and experienced traders to make informed
choices, diversify their approach, and learn from each other’s successes and setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collective learning is not just a feature-it’s a
foundation. As more traders engage with the community, share insights, and
follow disciplined leaders, the benefits multiply: risk is spread, knowledge is
deepened, and everyone has the chance to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Standard for Volatile Markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons from Week 9 are clear: adaptability, patience,
and community engagement are not just nice-to-haves-they are non-negotiable for
success in volatile markets. At EBC, we are committed to fostering an environment
where these qualities thrive, backed by robust technology, world-class regulation,
and a transparent, supportive community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As volatility continues to define the trading landscape, we
encourage every trader to embrace change, act with discipline, and leverage the
collective wisdom of the EBC community. In doing so, you are not just surviving
the storm-you are learning to navigate it with confidence and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

Key Focus: Tight-range activity near $3,400 as markets await the Fed&apos;s interest rate announcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;491&quot; data-end=&quot;537&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overview: Gold Futures at a Crossroads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;539&quot; data-end=&quot;861&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gold futures are stabilizing near $3,397 as traders brace for today’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. With the announcement expected at 2:00 p.m. ET and the press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET, this analysis helps you prepare for potential volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;863&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is gold about to do? That’s the big question on every trader’s mind. While the broader trend remains bullish, today&apos;s market behavior is largely influenced by caution, tight volume clusters, and key levels holding firm. The tradeCompass methodology can help guide your decision-making by mapping the important bullish and bearish thresholds — keeping you open to both outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1260&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Intraday Price Levels to Watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1337&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1306&quot; data-end=&quot;1337&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Developing VWAP: $3,394.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1340&quot; data-end=&quot;1391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current Volume Point of Control (POC): $3,400&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1392&quot; data-end=&quot;1430&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1394&quot; data-end=&quot;1430&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s VWAP &amp;amp; POC: $3,390&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1431&quot; data-end=&quot;1477&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1433&quot; data-end=&quot;1477&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current Value Area: $3,381.5 to $3,407&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1478&quot; data-end=&quot;1570&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1480&quot; data-end=&quot;1570&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Important Overhead Level: $3,422.8 (Value Area Low from April 22, all-time high day)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1571&quot; data-end=&quot;1630&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1573&quot; data-end=&quot;1630&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Lower Support Level: $3,366.2 (Yesterday’s VAL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1631&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1633&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Critical Bearish Threshold: $3,350&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1678&quot; data-end=&quot;1721&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;tradeCompass Thresholds &amp;amp; Scenarios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1723&quot; data-end=&quot;1767&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Upside Breakout Threshold: $3,422.8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1769&quot; data-end=&quot;1968&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This marks the Value Area Low from April 22, when gold hit its all-time high.

These levels offer a structured way to assess price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2798&quot; data-end=&quot;2845&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Stay Neutral, Stay Prepared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2847&quot; data-end=&quot;3076&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This Gold Futures analysis does not predict direction. Instead, it helps you stay nimble as you trade around key levels. The tradeCompass guide provides clear reference points for traders managing risk in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3078&quot; data-end=&quot;3322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As gold dances around $3,400, don&apos;t expect a decisive breakout until after the Fed speaks. When it happens, watch how price interacts with the thresholds outlined above. Let the market reveal its direction — and be ready to act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3329&quot; data-end=&quot;3512&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Disclaimer:
This is not financial advice. This analysis is provided for decision support only as part of the tradeCompass methodology. Always trade at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 78 bps (99% probability of no change at today&apos;s announcement)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 62 bps (92% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 94 bps (91% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 48 bps (54% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 110 bps (97% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 72 bps (67% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 44 bps (99% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 10 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change happened with the SNB pricing as dovish comments from SNB officials and the lower than expected Swiss inflation data reinforced the expectations for the central bank to go back to negative rates. That&apos;s been weighing on the CHF especially amid a better risk mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the first trade deal will have a big impact on interest rates expectations and that&apos;s what the market is waiting for at the moment. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;best case scenario&lt;/a&gt;, we could even see the market price in just one rate cut for the Fed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

The average rate of the most popular US home loan continues to stay elevated though, holding just under 7% after the surge higher in April.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bitcoin consolidates above a key level as all-time highs continue to be in sight</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that as the stock market rebounded on positive expectations for trade deals, so did Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is driven by the same macro factors that influence the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now in a bit of a consolidation as we await the next key catalyst which will likely be the details of the first trade deal. Everything revolves around that because on the rates front, the Fed is not going to cut amid this uncertainty until the labour market cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore the focus remains on that first trade deal which US officials continue to repeat will likely be announced by the end of the week (or Monday at the latest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will want to see if 10% is the floor or we can get lower. Above 10% will likely be taken as a disappointment and should trigger another selloff. Conversely, a rate below 10% (the lower the better) should take us to all-time highs pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that the price broke above the key resistance zone around the 90K level and went into a bit of a consolidation around the 95K level as the market awaits new information on the trade front. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the 90K level to position for a rally into the all-time highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to extend the drop into the 85K level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the price action formed what looks like an expanding rising wedge. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the 90K level. Watch out for the FOMC decision today as it could provide a dip-buying opportunity as the market continues to keep a positive outlook for the first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;
