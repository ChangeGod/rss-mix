Its used as the main retail sales indicator for the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NZD/USD barely changed on this data release. The Kiwi $ is moving around mainly on global developments, not local data:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A snippet from BMO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;today’s bear steepening was about pricing out the chance of a US recession in the near-term&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a severe enough equity market correction can change the hiring behavior of business leaders, spending patterns of consumers, and trajectory of the real economy. As the S&amp;amp;P 500 is now back in positive territory for 2025, it follows intuitively that there are lower odds of a market-inspired pullback in spending/hiring that triggers an economic slowdown. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tone shift from the Administration implies that the Trump put remains relevant and the President continues to view equity market performance as a real-time barometer of his performance in office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ps ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;75&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A bear steepening refers to a move in the bond market where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;77&quot; data-end=&quot;266&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;77&quot; data-end=&quot;137&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;79&quot; data-end=&quot;137&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Long-term yields rise faster than short-term yields,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;138&quot; data-end=&quot;181&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;140&quot; data-end=&quot;181&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Causing the yield curve to steepen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;182&quot; data-end=&quot;266&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;184&quot; data-end=&quot;266&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And it typically reflects expectations of stronger growth or higher inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs targets for the benchmark US S&amp;amp;P 500, ICYMI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-month target 5,900, GS see the current advance stalling in the short term&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;up from 5,700&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Already-optimistic market pricing of the economic growth outlook as well as uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of impending slowdown in economic and earnings growth will likely keep a ceiling on equity multiples during the next few months” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sees 6,500 in the next 12 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;up from 6,200 previously&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut S&amp;amp;P 500 forecasts twice in March, citing higher recession risk and tariff-related uncertainty. Say now that such concerns have eased: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;agreement between US and China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big Tech stocks should especially recover&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;buy caution that the broader earnings outlook is uneven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“Despite the recent improvement in the growth outlook, tariff rates will likely be substantially higher in 2025 than they were in 2024, putting pressure on profit margins&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysts have also revised their forecasts. Social media is alight with those lambasting changing calls. I know many years ago someone said he changes his forecasts as incoming information changes. I&apos;ve yet to see a better approach for traders, but perhaps the social media pundits know better. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Iran&apos;s Foreign Ministry says they&apos;ve made clear that agreement will not be reached with the US unless concrete guarantees have been made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments come ahead of a meeting of Iran with the E3 - Britain, France, and Germany - in Istanbul on Friday to lay the foundations for US-Iran talks after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US want Iran to quit its nukes.  That&apos;s the long story short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil markets are watching on for the prospect of more supply from Iran in the event of agreements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on oil:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/oil-private-survey-of-inventory-shows-headline-crude-oil-build-vs-draw-expected-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Oil: private survey of inventory shows headline crude oil build vs draw expected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The details were a tad on the cool side and overall CPI fell to the lowest since 2021. The moves were modest at first but steadily snowballed, adding up to a solid decline in the dollar across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in Fed pricing was more modest with the market continuing to price in a 40% chance of a cut in July and a near-certainty of a cut in September but all of those probabilities have been steadily sliding over the past three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that strong inflows to equities have been part of the reason for the recent strength in the dollar and that may be starting to ebb, though there were good buyers on ES futures dip ahead of the open and nice gains on the day (once again). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the momentum trade largely continued in stocks and oil but there were some cracks elsewhere as gold bounced and the dollar sagged. In fixed income, yields are nearing the Trump-admin high and that should start to get some attention in the days ahead, particularly as the focus shifts to the tax cut bill in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&apos;s driving Tesla&apos;s rise?</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/whats-driving-teslas-rise-20250513/</link>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Tesla
stock has increased&lt;/a&gt; by more than 24% in the past month.
While still far from the highs of $480 per share reached in March, investors
seem to have regained optimism, and surprisingly so. Last week, news broke that
Tesla&apos;s sales in China had declined for seven consecutive months. In addition,
new car sales in the U.K. fell 62% year-on-year in April. Why the sudden
turnaround in sentiment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason, as expected, is the renewed hope for
future improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, news broke in April that Elon Musk plans to reduce
his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to just one or two
days a week starting in May. The rest of his time, he said, will be focused on
his “business interests,” particularly Tesla. Investors have welcomed this
renewed focus on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, tensions between the United States and China have
eased slightly. The two countries recently agreed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.advfn.com/newspaper/igorkuchma/80141/are-the-trade-wars-finally-over&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;temporary
90-day tariff truce&lt;/a&gt; while they work to reach a broader
trade agreement. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese
imports from 145% to 30%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. imports from
125% to 10%. Theoretically, Tesla could benefit from the resulting drop in
tariff-related inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third catalyst is Tesla&apos;s plan to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/teslas-robotaxi-and-cybercab-trademarks-hit-roadblocks-ahead-of-june-launch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;its
autonomous driving software&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, Texas, next
June. If the RoboTaxi model is successful, it could give Tesla a technological
monopoly, resulting in significant cost savings for the cab industry. The
RoboTaxi could drive strong domestic demand before expanding to other OECD countries
because cabs are expensive in Europe and the United States. If it works, it
could be a significant value catalyst for Tesla, a key point in Ark Invest and
Cathie Wood&apos;s investment thesis. The big question now is whether Tesla can
deliver the product on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are still risks. Any delays in the
RoboTaxi rollout could hurt the stock. Further geopolitical tensions —
especially between the U.S. and the EU — could also pose a threat to Tesla’s
global operations. And while Musk may be refocusing on the company, that
doesn’t guarantee a quick rebound in vehicle demand. At the end of the day,
Tesla has always been more of a speculative play than a fundamentally grounded
one.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;144&quot; data-end=&quot;451&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD continues to grind higher after sellers failed to hold a break below key support at the 0.5825 swing area and the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart (lower green line at 0.58525). That dip yesterday and into today, quickly reversed, and buyers have regained control, driving the pair back above several key topside technical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;453&quot; data-end=&quot;535&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since then, the NZDUSD has been checking off resistance milestones, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;536&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;536&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;538&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day MA at 0.5883&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;592&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;559&quot; data-end=&quot;592&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-hour and 200-hour MAs at 0.5907 and 0.5835 respectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;593&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;595&quot; data-end=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The current push is targeting the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, a level near 0.5949&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;690&quot; data-end=&quot;849&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum remains on the side of buyers, and a move above 0.5949 would open the door for a run toward the next major resistance zone near 0.6000 and above that the extremes for 2025 between 0.6018 and 0.6028. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;851&quot; data-end=&quot;1068&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sellers had their shot yesterday and at the start of trading today. It&apos;s the buyers turn now.  So far, the MAs have been ticked off one at at a time, but there is one more to get through at 0.59494.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1075&quot; data-end=&quot;1100&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1101&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1101&quot; data-end=&quot;1172&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1103&quot; data-end=&quot;1172&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.59494 (4H 100-bar MA), 0.6000, 0.6018 to 0.6028 (highs for the year)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1175&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5935 (swing/MA cluster), 0.5907 (100 hour MA), 0.5883 (200 day MA),0.58525 (200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1264&quot; data-end=&quot;1317&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: shifting back to the buyers after the sellers had their shot and missed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A day of lower-tier data head, nothing here to move major FX too much upon release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wage growth data from Australia may attract some attention. Strong wage growth can help fuel inflation, and the Reserve Bank of Australia is still not comfortable declaring a win over inflation pressure. The Bank has begun to cut its cash rate, though, and another 25bp cut is widely expected at next week&apos;s meeting (19 and 20 May). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $63.67. That is up $1.72 or 2.78%. The price is up for the fifth day in six trading days and four days in a row. Since closing at $57.15 on May 5, the price has moved up 11.38%.The close today was the highest since April 17 when the price closed at $63.68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key target comes against the 50% midpoint of the range since the April 2020 low. That level comes in at $64.71. The high intraday price from April 23 reached $61.55 – just short of that midpoint level. Swing lows going back to December 2021 stalled near that area (see yellow area on the chart below). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the rally is fueled by easing trade tensions, a recent U.S.–UK deal, and expectations for stronger demand heading into the U.S. driving season. However, gains are being capped by rising global supply, with OPEC+ accelerating the return of 2.2 million bpd in cuts and the EIA forecasting significant inventory builds throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;What happened to the Tea Party?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal conservatism continues to die a slow death in the United States and the bond market may be taking notice. The latest Congressional estimates from the  Joint Committee on Taxation show a $3.8 trillion increase in the deficit over 10 years, or about 14% of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put differently, this would add about $11,000 in debt for every American and for FY 2026, it would add $481 billion to the deficit, about 1.5 pp of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding &apos;no tax on tips&apos; and &apos;no tax on overtime&apos; until 2029. Now these estimates are just on the revenue side (though not all of it) so there are some spending cuts to come but so far Republicans are struggling to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the bond market, we&apos;re getting perilously close to 5% for 30-year yields.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;142&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is pushing higher again and now approaches a key resistance area between 1.1193 and 1.1213 — a zone that has capped rallies multiple times in the past, including three peaks in July and August 2024. The high price has reached 1.11823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;641&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding weight to the topside test is the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, currently sitting near 1.1209, right in the heart of the resistance zone. The 100-hour moving average is also in play and in that area at 1.12101 (not shown on the chart above). A clean break above this cluster would strengthen the bullish case and open the door for further upside momentum.  Conversely it could also be a level where sellers may look to lean with a stop on a break above. As such it is important for both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;643&quot; data-end=&quot;1045&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the closest support comes in at 1.11452, which previously acted as a swing high in early April and is now a short-term line in the sand for buyers. Holding above it keeps the bullish structure intact. A break below would shift the focus back toward the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally at 1.10395, and further to the 1.1000 natural support level. Yesterday the low price after the fall on the China US tariff news reached 1.1065 – well short of that 38.2% retracement target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.1193–1.1213 (swing zone), 1.1209 (200-bar MA), 1.1210 (100 hour moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1146&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.11452 (near-term swing), 1.1065 (low from yesterday, 1.10395 (38.2% retracement of move up from the January 2025 low), 1.1000 (natural support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1251&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Buyers make a play but work to do. Modest bullish bias while above 1.11452; but stronger upside if 1.1213 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While the pair may consolidate near 1.40 in the near term, BofA sees medium-term downside to 1.35 and recommends a 1-year RKO (reverse knock-out) put to express that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;433&quot; data-end=&quot;448&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;Revised Forecast: USD/CAD is now expected to end 2025 at 1.38 (previously 1.40), with potential to reach 1.35 in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;597&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;599&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;Drivers of CAD Strength: April’s rally was fueled by a BoC rate cut pause, expectations for fiscal expansion, and anticipated investment inflows—factors BofA believes may have driven temporary CAD overvaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;Near-Term Outlook: BofA sees USD/CAD trading sideways around 1.40 over the next two quarters before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;964&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;966&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;Trade Strategy: A 1-year RKO put is favored to cheaply express a bearish view while taking advantage of current skew pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1105&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1107&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;Macro Risk: The main risk is a North American recession in 2025, which would trigger renewed USD strength and invalidate the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;BofA remains moderately bearish USD/CAD into 2025, targeting 1.35 medium-term, but sees near-term consolidation.

America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a
 beautiful thing!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market pricing is for 51 bps in easing this year, starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s no surprise the Treasury is announcing new sanctions with Trump talking about Iran and visiting the Middle East. The latest sanctions target the global network shipping Iranian oil, the Treasuy wrote in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude oil is up $1.79 to $63.74 today. The S&amp;amp;P 500 just crossed +1%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is trading to new site session highs as Pres. Trump completes his speech in Saudi Arabia. Toward the end of his speech he did say that he will order the cessation of sanctions against Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is now up 316 points or 1.69% at 19024.53. The high price came in at 19024.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday recall, the price extended above its 100-day moving average currently at 18466.65. That was the first break - and close - above  that moving average since February 24. The price also moved above a swing low from January 13 at 18831.91. Both of those levels will now be close support. Staying above is more bullish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyers are taking back more control. The next target comes against the high price from February 27 at 19286.02. Above that and were in the upper extreme which peaked at 20204.58 on December 16. That was the all-time high for the index.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD is continuing to push higher, breaking above its 100-hour moving average (blue line on the chart above) and swing level which are both at 1.3257. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum to the upside has continued to the 200-hour moving average at 1.32837. That moving average was tested on Friday&apos;s trade, but found willing sellers after a failed break above fizzled quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move above the 200-hour moving average would give the buyers more control with a high price from Friday&apos;s trade at 1.3223 the next target.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump continues and says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working hard to end Russia/Ukraine bloodshed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks could produce good results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rubio is going to talks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;One of the early lessons of Trump&apos;s second term is that when he says to buy stocks, the market goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s being less explicit this time and didn&apos;t write it on Truth Social so I&apos;d be cautious. Previously, he tweeted it before announcing good news like removing reciprocal tariffs and the China deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 0.8% and hasn&apos;t reacted since his comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of his other comments are on geopolitics like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest destructive force in the middle east is Iran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
