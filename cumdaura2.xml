                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinflation in domestic prices, wage pressures is continuing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expect gradual easing of inflation pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall impact of tariffs on inflation is still uncertain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following developments of UK-US trade deal closely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven&apos;t been briefed about the details of the matter however&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hopes for the trade deal to reduce uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need to watch carefully for second-round effects of inflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But that is not in our base case scenario&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A will be more interesting as he will be pressed on voting intentions by both Mann and Pill. But I would expect Bailey to deflect those questions. Besides that, Bailey is also just reaffirming that there doesn&apos;t seem to be much details coming to surface now on the trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Similar to February, it&apos;s a case of focusing on voting intentions when it comes to the BOE reaction. The central bank moved to cut the bank rate by 25 bps to 4.25% as expected. However, the vote split is what is raising eyebrows as we look to digest the situation. Dhingra and Taylor voting for a 50 bps rate cut is somewhat expected but both Mann and Pill voting for the bank rate to be unchanged is the standout here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That is leading to traders leaning towards this as being more of a hawkish cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Once again, Mann is stealing the spotlight as she did with February when she voted for a 50 bps rate cut at the time. Today, she&apos;s siding with calling for the central bank not to move forward with a rate cut. So, I guess she has found back her hawkish roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As much as the vote split is looking rather messy here, let&apos;s take a step back to see what that actually means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Considering global trade developments lately, there&apos;s plenty for central banks and policymakers to debate. And let&apos;s face the facts, there&apos;s going to be differing opinions on that and what the impact from Trump&apos;s tariffs will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And that is perhaps what we&apos;re seeing here. In the case of the Fed and most other central banks, perhaps things are less transparent. All we get is the supposed &quot;consensus&quot; view/decision and policymakers have to do their part and show unanimity rather than be explicit about how they really feel at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But in the case of the BOE, the bank rate vote does what it does. It presents an opportunity for policymakers to express their desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;What I&apos;m saying is that the bank rate vote perhaps just reflects the debate that all other central banks are having, but not being upfront and frank about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Either way, it&apos;s a fact now that policymakers at the BOE are having mixed views. And that spells uncertainty on how the decisions in the coming months will play out.&lt;/p&gt;

GBP/USD is up to 1.3306 now from around 1.3250 before the decision. In terms of communique, there isn&apos;t much change to the statement whatsoever. The BOE maintains that they will continue with a &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;careful&quot; approach, similar to that in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Once again, it will be a repeat of February where the focus and attention will be placed on voting intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Back then, Catherine Mann voted for a 50 bps rate cut and that surprised markets with the reaction centering on that. This time around, it&apos;s the same with Mann voting to keep rates unchanged instead alongside Huw Pill.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;“Too Late” Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much! Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and “eggs”) down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S. — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF “TOO LATE!” ENJOY!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all expected Trump to be pissed about the Fed decision yesterday and here he comes with another post mocking the Fed Chair. The good thing is that he can&apos;t do anything about it and Powell will remain the Fed Chair until May 2026. After that even if Trump picks a Fed Chair he likes, the policy adjustments are decided on a majority basis.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The two-minute delay is to commemorate VE Day, so just be wary of that. As for what to expect, here is what analysts are saying ahead of the decision (h/t @ MNI Markets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;HSBC- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;There are a number of on-off doves who could join the more steadfast Ms Dhingra (Dave
Ramsden, Alan Taylor and Catherine Mann) in voting for a 50bp reduction&quot;- “It is not our central case that it will cut in June. But it is possible, and if the Committee also
thinks it is possible, it may want to signal that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Citi- 25 bps rate cut (9-0, 8-1, 7-2 votes all plausible)- “A unanimous vote for a 25bp cut looks plausible, though it is possible that external MPC
member Dhingra could see the need for additional, pre-emptive easing and vote for a 50bp
step&quot;- &quot;Our expectation is still for another hold in June, with cuts at every meeting this year thereafter&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;ING- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;The messaging from officials so far this year has
made us less convinced of that, and instead, we think the path of least resistance is for the
Bank to keep cutting rates once per quarter&quot;- &quot;That process could, however, continue for longer than markets are now pricing. We think
Bank Rate will fall to 3.25% by mid-2026 and possibly even a little lower than that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;JP Morgan- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;There is a risk others consider a 50 bps cut too, e.g. Mann&quot;- &quot;Our best guess is that the BoE won’t drop “gradual and careful” from its guidance&quot;- &quot;There is a risk, however, that the BoE could revamp its guidance entirely, indicating that it
sees risks to inflation in both directions and is willing to respond as necessary&quot;- A pause in June is expected next before sequential cuts
between August and November to 3.50% by year-end&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Reuters reported that OPEC+ was considering to further speed up oil production hikes as Saudi Arabia signalled it was unwilling to prop up the market any longer amid poor compliance with production quotas from Iraq and Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market opened with a big negative gap, but there was no follow through, in fact the market started to slowly fill the gap and eventually we erased all the losses as if that never happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s been lots of focus on the supply side recently given the OPEC+ moves, but changes on the demand side could start to gather attention. In fact, we are finally getting some details on the first trade deals with the US set to announce a framework for a deal with the UK today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve laid out a non-consensus opportunity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/a-non-consensus-trade-opportunity-as-the-selloff-in-crude-oil-gathers-attention-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and today we might get the first catalyst for a rally depending on the details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see the negative gap that was eventually filled and the key resistance around the $60.00 level. The buyers will need to break above that resistance to target the $62-64 price area next. The sellers, on the other hand, will likely step in around the resistance with a defined risk above it to position for a drop back into the $55.00 level. This might even turn into a big double bottom, but we will need positive developments on the trade front.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come. Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Again, a lot of big words but the devil will be in the details. I would expect this to just be more of a skeleton/outline on what both sides are looking for in exchange. In other words, basically just look towards some form of tariffs reduction and concessions in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, this should be one of the more straightforward deals to be struck as the UK was not on the reciprocal tariffs list to begin with. This is due to the more balanced nature of trade between the two countries. So, the UK has &quot;only&quot; been slapped with the blanket 10% tariffs as well as tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So if getting a full deal here is already a long process, you can imagine how long it will take for other countries that are not as close an ally to the US. I&apos;d take Trump&apos;s &quot;many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation&quot; with a pinch of salt really.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is reported that the UK has agreed to give some concessions on food and agriculture imports from the US in exchange for lower tariffs on autos. The details of the exchange are still unclear as of yet, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s not so much a big deal for the US but for the UK at least, some 18% of its car exports do go to the US. As for the flip side, it is one thing to offer a concession allowing for more agriculture imports. But the issue here is that supposedly a lot of US produce do not even meet UK regulation standards. So, how will that be changed?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;This should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Press Conference at The Oval Office, 10A.M. Thank you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Again, that will be at 1400 GMT. We all already know now that it will be an agreement to the terms for a trade deal i.e. framework for the upcoming negotiations. The important part will be to see if there will be any follow up details though. US futures are continuing to race higher on the headline here, with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures now up 1.1% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report pretty much confirms that this is a &quot;heads of terms&quot; agreement. In other words, it is a preliminary agreement and a &quot;substantive&quot; step towards a full deal. As for the details, it is all still rather lacking at the moment. Sky&apos;s deputy political editor, Sam Coates, added that this is also a positive step ahead of the UK-EU summit on 19 May:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;I think it is politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU - or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The positive news on trade deals continue to boost the US Dollar. This has more to do with positioning rather than fundamentals for now. In fact, the short dollar trade has been one of the most crowded ones and therefore it&apos;s at risk of unwindings on positive news on the trade front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY is now up more than 0.6% on the day as the positive risk sentiment weighs on the Japanese Yen. For the USD, there&apos;s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; where we could see a bigger upside move if very good outcomes on the trade front make the market to reprice interest rate expectations all the way down to just one cut for the Fed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Technical Analysis – Trump’s announcement weighs on the precious metal</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed yesterday kept its
usual neutral stance and Fed Chair Powell didn’t offer anything in terms of
forward guidance citing elevated uncertainty. The event didn’t move gold since
there wasn’t anything new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What impacted gold negatively
was Trump saying that he would make a big announcement concerning a major trade
deal today. Reports are saying that it will be a framework for a trade deal
with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture, gold
remains in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid Fed
easing. But in the short-term positive news on the tariffs front or a hawkish
Fed could trigger more downside for gold as the market prices out
stagflationary fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that gold rallied back above the 3400 level recently on some negative tariff
related headlines. Trump’s announcement though triggered some downside on
positive expectations. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have
a better risk to reward setup around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt;, while the sellers will look for a
break lower to increase the bearish bets into the 2957 level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see the price recently broke above the key swing level at 3367 before extending
the rally above the 3400 level. The price fell back below the 3367 level and
from a risk management perspective, the sellers will likely want to see a
pullback into the level to position for further downside. The buyers, on the
other hand, will want to see the price rising back above the 3367 level to pile
in for a rally into a new all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor downward trendline now defining the current pullback. If
the price gets there, we can expect the sellers to lean on the trendline with a
defined risk above it to position for a drop into the 3258 level next. The
buyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish
bets into new highs. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures and
Trump announcing the outline for a trade deal with the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is trading higher now to start European trading as the UK confirms that Trump&apos;s announcement later will be an agreement to a framework for a trade deal. This means laying out the groundwork and discussion points for negotiations over the next few weeks/months, but at least there is some progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY has raced higher to around 144.40 now with EUR/USD easing slightly to 1.1285 on the day from around 1.1305 earlier. GBP/USD is also down 0.1% to 1.3285 while USD/CHF is up 0.4% to 0.8270 currently. Meanwhile, gold is down 1.2% to $3,324 as sellers look to break the near-term bullish hold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/gold-dips-lower-as-market-hopes-build-on-us-uk-trade-deal-announcement-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As things stand, there are two main things that market players are hoping to be more optimistic about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The first will come today from Trump&apos;s announcement later at 1400 GMT. That will involve the agreement to the framework for a trade deal between the US and UK. It&apos;s a good first step to reaching a deal and while it might seem like a formality, you never know with Trump. But I think at this point, this should be a given - it&apos;s just a matter of when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The interesting point to watch out for though is the details on what tariffs will be stuck in place for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, the UK is part of the shortlist of six countries that Trump has deemed as a &quot;priority&quot; to get a deal done. The others being India, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. And as another reminder, the UK was not part of the initial reciprocal tariffs list considering the more balanced nature of trade with the US. So, they were &quot;only&quot; slapped with a blanket 10% tariff alongside other tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So, it will be important to see what levels the UK will be stuck with on any deal. And that will also help set the tone on what to expect from other countries, in particular those higher up on the initial reciprocal tariffs list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The second main thing is the supposed trade talk between the US and China this weekend. While the US camp is saying that this is a &quot;starting point&quot; for negotiations, the Chinese camp has been labelling this meeting as a mere &quot;engagement&quot; or &quot;touch point&quot;. The exact wording used by the Chinese embassy is &apos;接触&apos;. So, that might offer some insight as to how both sides are going to approach the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;At best, we will get to see both sides engage in more talks over the coming weeks/months. But even so, what happens in between all of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If Trump&apos;s position is as what he said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-says-he-isnt-open-to-lowering-china-tariffs-to-get-them-to-the-negotiating-table-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, it is going to be tough to see any fruitful discussions between the two countries. We&apos;ll see the can keep being kicked down the road and in the meantime, the tariffs in place will continue to bite at both economies as well as the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, there&apos;s plenty of hope for things to turn out for the better as we look towards the end of the week. But it&apos;s also best to reminded that the reality of the situations above might end up differing a lot from what traders are hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That might gear us towards a buy the rumour, sell the fact predicament in the bigger picture. That unless Trump continues to find new stories to keep propping up the market that is.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the only highlight is the BoE policy decision. The central bank is expected to cut by 25 bps bringing the bank rate to 4.25% with a 9-0 vote split (although Dhingra could vote for a 50 bps cut). This is widely expected as the BoE has been repeating that cutting once every quarter would be their preferred plan. The focus will be on the language and a potential change to the &quot;gradual and careful&quot; guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the focus will switch to the US Jobless Claims as it&apos;s the most timely indicator of the labour market. Initial Claims are expected at 230K vs 241K prior, while Continuing Claims are seen at 1886K vs 1916K prior. The market is unlikely to care much about the data unless we see a spike above the 260K level as that&apos;s been the highest level reached since 2022 and could trigger fears of a deterioration in the labour market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main event of the day will be at 14:00 GMT/10:00 ET when Trump said that he would make a big announcement concerning a major trade deal. Reports are saying that it will be a framework for a trade deal with the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is gaining some slight ground but gold is among the more noticeable movers to start the session. The precious metal is now down 0.7% on the day and touching a low of $3,336. That is running close to the 100-hour moving average (red line) of $3,330. Keep above and the near-term bias stays more bullish but break below that and the bias will turn more neutral instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latest headlines comes from the UK, with media reports confirming that Trump is to announce a &quot;heads of terms&quot; agreement i.e. framework of a deal. The announcement will take place at 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Even with this though, there will be more negotiations to follow. But after a bit of a setback with Japan, this at least will help set the tone for what may come next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, it is best to be reminded that the UK was not on the reciprocal tariffs list from the onset. This is due to the balanced nature of goods trade between the UK and the US. So, they have only been subject to the 10% blanket tariffs and steel, aluminum, auto tariffs. Is that a key factor to help with moving things along? I would argue so. So, there&apos;s that to consider too.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;UK official confirms Trump expected to announce US deal outline. The official added that the two countries had made good progress that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars. As a reminder, the US imposed the baseline 10% global tariff rate on UK.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;In light of the national two minutes of silence to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE day, the Monetary Policy Report and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting will be published at 12.02pm (BST) on Thursday 8 May 2025, instead of the regular time of 12pm (BST).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Just a heads up ahead of the decision later, in case you might wonder why there is a &quot;delay&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

The reports are suggesting this to be with the UK but the devil is in the details. As mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/risk-stays-buoyed-as-traders-eye-trumps-trade-deal-announcement-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it might not be all that is hyped up to be. So, we&apos;ll see how Trump wants to sell the narrative and if markets can continue the rebound on the week after the fact. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are seen up 0.6% currently as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior -0.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slight delay in the release by the source. UK house prices beat estimates to climb in April, with the average property price moving up to £297,781. Halifax notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know the stamp duty changes prompted a surge in transactions in the early part of this year, as
buyers rushed to beat the tax-rise deadline. However, this didn&apos;t lead to a significant increase in property prices, with the last six months characterised by a stability in prices rarely seen since the
pandemic. While the market has cooled slightly since this rush, buyer activity remains strong in
comparison to recent years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mortgage rates have continued to fall, with most lenders now offering rates below 4%. Coupled with
positive earnings growth that has outpaced broader inflation, these factors have helped to steadily
improve affordability for many buyers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the market continues to show resilience despite a subdued economic environment and risks
from geopolitical developments. There is likely to be a bump-up in consumer price inflation as
household bills increase, but with further base rate cuts also expected, we anticipate a similar trend of
modest price growth this year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
