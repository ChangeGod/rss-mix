                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;151&quot; data-end=&quot;320&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD extended higher yesterday and again earlier today, but both rallies have stalled just ahead of a key resistance confluence. The area of interest includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day moving average, currently near 1.40111&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;382&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;384&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The swing area resistance between 1.4009 and 1.4027&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;440&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;442&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s high stopped at 1.40157 before rotating back lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;506&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This zone has now rejected buyers on two separate occasions, reinforcing its role as a critical barrier that bulls must break to extend the upside bias. A clean move above 1.4027 would open the door toward the 38.2%% retracement of the move down from the March high at 1.40525, with other key resistance around the 50% and swing area between 1.4146–1.41836.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;1193&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the initial support now comes in near 1.3978, where the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart lines up with the old swing high from April 15. Holding above that level keeps the rebound and short term bullish bias intact. A move below it, however, could trigger a deeper correction down to 1.389172 1.3904 swing area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1200&quot; data-end=&quot;1225&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1228&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.4009–1.4027 (200-day MA + swing), 1.40525 (38.2% retracement), 1.4146 to 1.41836 (50% and swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1303&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3978 (4H 200-bar MA/old high from April 15), 1.38917 – 1.3904 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1390&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1392&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral to bullish above 1.3978; stronger bullish bias only above 1.4027 and then the 38.2% retracement at 1.40525&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Details of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney&apos;s cabinet are leaking out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Francois-Philippe Champagne to be finance minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Hodgson named minister of energy and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dominic Leblanc remains in charge of US-Canada trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrystia Freeland remains minister for transport and internal trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Melanie Joly  named industry minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are mostly familiar faces. Champagne and Leblanc travelled to Washington in March at the peak of tariff anxiety and seemed to get along with Lutnick and others at the White House so that may be a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical name will be Tim Hodgson who worked with Carney at Goldman Sachs and was the Chair of Hydro One. He was recruited by Carney to run and will have a big job in developing Canadian energy and pipelines while navigating/rewriting brutal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market is exhibiting diverse patterns today, with notable sector-specific performance highlighting varying investor outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology Storms Ahead: The technology sector is experiencing substantial growth. Nvidia (NVDA) is a major highlight, surging by 5.00%, driven by robust performance expectations and increased demand for AI technologies. Oracle (ORCL) and Palantir (PLTR) also see significant gains, up 2.13% and 4.33%, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical Resilience: The consumer cyclical arena is buoyant, with Amazon (AMZN) climbing 2.81%. Tesla (TSLA) also rejoices with a rise of 1.24%, reflecting positive market sentiment towards these retail and automotive giants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Sector Under Pressure: Conversely, the healthcare sector suffers, with UnitedHealth (UNH) nosediving 14.80%, dragging down overall sentiment. Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) also face declines of 0.43% and 3.73%, respectively, possibly due to unfavorable earnings reports or regulatory challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Services Ascend: The sector, guided by Google (GOOG) up 1.00%, showcases a robust outlook, supported by positive investor confidence in digital advertising prospects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s trading landscape paints a picture of mixed sentiment. Investors are clearly favoring tech and consumer cyclical stocks, likely due to optimism surrounding emerging technologies and consumer spending potential. However, the pronounced downturn in the healthcare sector suggests caution, perhaps due to policy discussions or earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering today’s performance, investors are encouraged to monitor the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capitalize on Technology: Given the upbeat trajectory in tech, maintaining or increasing exposure to key players like Nvidia and Oracle could capitalize on ongoing trends. Pay close attention to innovations and earnings announcements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review Healthcare Holdings: With current uncertainties, reconsideration of holdings in the healthcare sector is advisable. Keep an eye on regulatory changes and future earnings guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification Remains Key: Well-balanced portfolios across resilient sectors, including communication services and stable consumer cyclical stocks, can mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay informed with real-time updates and comprehensive analyses at ForexLive.com to adeptly navigate the market&apos;s evolving dynamics. 📈&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;159&quot; data-end=&quot;398&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF moved higher yesterday on the back of broad USD strength, but momentum stalled before reaching the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.84823. The high price reached 0.8475.  That retracement level remains a critical hurdle for any sustained recovery.  Absent that, and the correction higher is just a plain-vanilla variety and keeps the sellers in play.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;400&quot; data-end=&quot;686&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, price action has rotated lower but found support at a well-defined swing area between 0.8368 and 0.84087 — a zone that has served as a floor going back to August 2024. Buyers stepped in as the pair tested the lower end of that support band during the European/early US session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also helping to reinforce the support is the falling 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near the swing low. That technical confluence is attracting dip buyers, at least for now. The current price is above the swing area high at 0.84087.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support holding on the dip has set the stage for the battle between the buyers down to 0.8369 and the sellers up to 0.84823.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;901&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In summary, bulls will need to see a break above 0.84823 (38.2% retracement) to tilt the bias more favorably to the upside. On the downside, a break back below 0.8368 would open the door toward deeper targets and shift the bias firmly back to bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1192&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1195&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8368–0.84087 (swing area), 0.8318 to 0.8340 (swing area), 0.82723 (low from late April)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1285&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.84823 (38.2% retrace), 0.85309 to 0.85573 (swing), 0.86193 (50% retrace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1367&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral above 0.8368; bullish above 0.84823; bearish below 0.8368&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fear has been replaced by FOMO in markets. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now up 40 points and getting to within striking distance of 6000, which we haven&apos;t been above since March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market continues to digest the US-China trade war climb down and it likes what it&apos;s hearing. We are expecting comments from Trump shortly so that could be a source of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zooming out to the daily chart, there isn&apos;t much standing in the way of a return to the February all-time highs now.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;China has announced the things that were pledged on Sunday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To adjust tariff rates on US goods on May 14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To pause the 24% tariff rate on US goods for 90 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sets tariff rate at 10%, as expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;says reduction in tariffs meets expectations of producers and consumers in both countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To cancel additional tariffs imposed on US products under two later rounds of measures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure on the significance of this but I think it&apos;s highlighting that they need to see further progress. US stocks have been bid since the open, reversing earlier selling in the futures market. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;54&quot; data-end=&quot;531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday the GBPUSD tumbled lower on the back of the China/US tariff fall and suspension, and in the process sliced through the familiar swing zone at 1.32598 (see green numbered circles) and the lower band between 1.3232‑1.3241 (see red numbered circles), then briefly pierced the 38.2 % retrace of the April rally at 1.31603, printing a session low of 1.3139.  Momentum dried up quickly; the pair rebounded back above the retracement and used it as a launchpad in late US trading and early Asian-Pacific trading today.  The low price today held at 1.31639, keeping that Fibonacci level intact as risk‑defining support.  Remember that level going forward on any reversal back to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;533&quot; data-end=&quot;974&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound helped by the lower CPI today in the US has carried price back into the congestion corridor .  The first layer of topside work sits at the old swing floor turned ceiling between 1.3232 and 1.3241, followed by the swing level and 100‑hour moving average which both come in at 1.32598.  A decisive break above that 100‑hour MA would open the door toward the 200‑hour MA at 1.32845. A break above would re‑energise the upside once again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;976&quot; data-end=&quot;1312&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Failing to clear the 100 and 200 hour moving averages would keep the sellers in play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1319&quot; data-end=&quot;1357&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels (one‑liners):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1359&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1359&quot; data-end=&quot;1412&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1361&quot; data-end=&quot;1412&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Short term bias defining level intraday: 1.32320‑1.32410 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1413&quot; data-end=&quot;1456&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1415&quot; data-end=&quot;1456&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance 1: 1.32598 (100‑hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1457&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance 2: ≈1.3284 (200‑hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1457&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 1: 1.3201 to 1.32067 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1567&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1569&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 2: 1.3160 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1612&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 3: 1.3139 (low from yesterday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;104&quot; data-end=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s announcement of a 90‑day suspension of some US‑China tariffs lit a fire under USDJPY, propelling the pair from a gap higher low 145.71, to a session peak at 148.64.
That rally stopped cold in a long‑standing swing zone between 148.56 and 148.73 (red arrows on the chart) — the same band that capped price action multiple times in February–March and going back to December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;465&quot; data-end=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the mood has shifted. A lower‑than‑expected US CPI print clipped US yields and the dollar, knocking USDJPY back lower.  Despite the setback, buyers still hold the near‑term edge while price remains above the first support target:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;722&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;722&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;724&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;147.20‑147.34 swing area dating to August 2024 (not shown)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;777&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;779&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;38.2 % retrace of the April rebound at 147.14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;830&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hold above that risk‑defining zone and the upside bias survives; break below and the recovery narrative starts to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;958&quot; data-end=&quot;1089&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, the market must clear yesterday’s 148.73 high to reignite momentum.  A break would expose a cluster of hurdles including the::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1243&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1144&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1093&quot; data-end=&quot;1144&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;50 % retrace of the 2025 decline at 149.38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1145&quot; data-end=&quot;1176&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1147&quot; data-end=&quot;1176&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Daily 200‑MA at ≈149.58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1145&quot; data-end=&quot;1176&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1147&quot; data-end=&quot;1176&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Psychological 150.00 level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1177&quot; data-end=&quot;1243&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1179&quot; data-end=&quot;1243&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Daily 100‑MA 150.30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1387&quot; data-end=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels (single‑line bullets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1426&quot; data-end=&quot;1703&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1426&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1428&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 148.56‑148.73 (swing area), 149.38 (50 % retracement), 149.58 (200 day moving average), 150.30 (100 day moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1532&quot; data-end=&quot;1622&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1534&quot; data-end=&quot;1622&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 147.20‑147.34 (swing), 147.14 (38.2 %), 146.53 (prev low from March)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1623&quot; data-end=&quot;1703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1625&quot; data-end=&quot;1703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bullish while &amp;gt; 147-13 -147.20; break &amp;lt; 147.13 shifts focus to the downside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Mark Carney to unveil cabinet today</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will unveil is cabinet today in a move that could move the Canadian dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market still isn&apos;t sure how Carney will govern and his plan to &apos;build, baby, build&apos; and counter US tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/sets-the-tone-more-than-half-of-pm-carneys-new-cabinet-will-be-fresh-faces/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reporting &lt;/a&gt;said former Finance Minister and Trump-antagonist Chrystia Freeland would be left off the roster but that was quickly reversed and denied. It appears she will get a role and that&apos;s not a big surprise given that Carney is the godfather of her son and they&apos;ve long been close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney is looking to build national bridges though and she&apos;s carrying much of Trudeau&apos;s baggage. It would be a poor sign if she had a high profile position like Finance Minister. I suspect that will go to former Laurentian Bank economist Carlos Leitao, who was previously Quebec&apos;s Minister of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another portfolio to watch is Environment. That portfolio has been a major drag on Canadian construction and investment. Eco-warrior Steven Guilbeault will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsnews.com/the-mix/steven-guilbeault-to-remain-in-cabinet-source-10648622&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reportedly &lt;/a&gt;remain in cabinet but if it&apos;s in the environment file, it won&apos;t bode well for the loonie but early indications are that it&apos;s the Heritage file, which is also responsible for biodiversity, nature and Parks Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney is expected to name 30 cabinet ministers overall but early reporting indicates it will be many of the same faces from the Trudeau regime, with about half being new cabinet ministers along with a roster of 10 &apos;secretaries of state&apos; who will have portfolios but won&apos;t participate in most cabinet meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this, the market will be watching for the opening of parliament on May 27 and the throne speech.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;158&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is seeing a modest rebound today after sharp declines yesterday, driven in part by a stronger USD following news of US-China tariff reductions (set for a 90-day period at least). The move lower on Monday found buyers just ahead of the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally at 1.10395 — a level that remains a critical support line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;512&quot; data-end=&quot;636&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below that 38.2% level would signal a deeper corrective move is underway, shifting the bias further to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;512&quot; data-end=&quot;636&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is moving higher helped by the CPI data which was more modest than expectations (0.2% vs 0.3% for the headline and the core measures).  There has been a modest move higher with the pair trading to a new high at 1.11349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;638&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside technically, the pair now eyes the April 3 swing high at 1.11452. A sustained move above this level would tilt the bias more bullish and target the next resistance zone, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;831&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;831&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;833&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-bar MA (4H) currently near 1.1200&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A swing area up to 1.1213&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;916&quot; data-end=&quot;1098&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the bounce is corrective, but traders will be watching whether the pair can push through key resistance or fall back toward the retracement level to confirm trend direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1105&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1180&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1180&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.10395 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1181&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1183&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.11452 (Apr 3 swing), 1.1200–1.1213 (MA/swing zone and the 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1254&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1256&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral near-term; bearish below 1.10395, more bullish above 1.11452&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Crypto Lobbyists Turn Up the Heat in DC as August Regulation Buzz Grows</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Crypto mixing with DC politics? For the
longest time, that combination often spelled trouble—think friction, regulatory
fog, and sometimes, downright opposition from the powers that be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ground seems to be shifting
rapidly in 2025. The once-chilly regulatory environment is showing signs of a
thaw, spurred by a new administration&apos;s different tune and a crypto industry
ready to make its voice heard loud and clear inside the Beltway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t just quiet diplomacy; it&apos;s an
all-out push. Cryptocurrency advocates are flooding Washington, armed with
arguments, funding, and a sense of urgency. They see a window of opportunity
opening, especially with predictions floating around—even from major industry
players—that meaningful, pro-crypto regulations could start taking shape,
perhaps as soon as this August. It&apos;s a high-stakes moment, potentially setting
the stage for how digital assets integrate into the world&apos;s largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binance CEO:
Pro-Crypto Regulations Could Come to the US by August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent voices adding
fuel to the August expectation fire is Binance CEO Richard Teng. Speaking
recently, Teng suggested the US&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2025/04/30/binance-crypto-us-money/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; could see new, supportive crypto legislation&lt;/a&gt;
emerge by late summer. Teng explained his optimistic view under the Trump
administration, “The new efforts and optimism is very real in the US. So, I
believe the US is going to come out with very enlightened, pro-industry and
smart regulations that support the industry but also manages the risk at the
same time. So you’re probably going to see some of the new legislation coming
through by August this year.” This positive view is contrasted starkly with
what many in the industry perceived as the &quot;Operation Choke Point 2.0&quot;
environment of the previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teng sees the shift in the US potentiallyacting as a catalyst globally. As he noted at
the CONVERGE LIVE conference, when the world&apos;s biggest economy signals it wants
to embrace crypto, it prompts other governments to seriously consider their own
approaches. This perspective comes even as the administration&apos;saggressive
tariff policies introduced earlier in the year initially sent shockwaves
through global markets, including the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights a
potentially complex dynamic where trade protectionism coexists with a more
favorable stance on digital asset innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binance itself is navigating this market
from a position of strength, bolstered by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/mgx-backs-binance-in-landmark-investment-6242106085221073480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;landmark $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi&apos;s MGX&lt;/a&gt;—the
largest single investment into a crypto firm, paid entirely in stablecoins.
Furthermore, Teng has confirmed Binance isadvising
multiple governments and sovereign wealth funds on building their own national
digital asset reserves and regulatory frameworks, underlining the increasing
global trend towards state-level crypto engagement influenced partly by US
moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crypto
Lobbyists Are Flooding the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Teng&apos;s optimism isn&apos;t happening
in a vacuum; it&apos;s backed by an unprecedented level of activity from crypto
proponents on the ground in Washington. The industry isn&apos;t just knocking on
doors; it&apos;s practically setting up shop. We&apos;re talking aboutmore
than a dozen distinct groups—from established players like the Digital Chamber
of Commerce, the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation
(CCI) to newer, more focused entities like the Solana Policy Institute and the
National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surge reflects a feeling that now is
the time to influence policy. As Miller Whitehouse-Levine, now leading the
Solana Policy Institute, put it, there&apos;s an &quot;absolute torrent&quot; of
legislative and regulatory work happening, and the industry needs &quot;all the
help we could get.&quot; There&apos;s certainly plenty to tackle, with Congress
debating everything from market structure and stablecoin oversight to illicit
finance concerns and even government digital asset reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, having so many players can
lead to challenges. Insiders privately admit the field is getting crowded,
potentially leading to duplicated efforts or diluted messages when engaging
with the finite number of key congressional staff and administration officials.
Funding and membership can also become competitive points. Still, the
prevailing view seems to be that a united front, even across multiple
organizations, is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent wins, like the bipartisan pushback
against a potentially cripplingIRS
rule targeting DeFi, show that coordinated advocacy can yield results. On top
of the traditional lobbying, well-funded political action committees like
Fairshake and grassroots efforts like Coinbase&apos;s Stand With Crypto are flexing
their political muscle, aiming to ensure Congress remains crypto-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next On the
Table: A US Stablecoin Bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what&apos;s the most immediate focus of
all this activity? Eyes are firmly fixed on stablecoin regulation. These
digital dollars are seen as a critical bridge between traditional finance and
the crypto world, and getting the rules right is a top priority. Two bills, in
particular, are front and center: theSTABLE
Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these two bills are really trying to
do is build a rulebook for stablecoins across the US. They get into the
nitty-gritty—like which companies can actually create stablecoins, demanding
they hold reliable reserves (think cash or safe government bonds), and setting
up oversight. The fact that both pieces of legislation actuallymade
it through their House and Senate committees this spring, and with lawmakers
from both parties agreeing, was a pretty big step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact timing, the
momentum behind stablecoin legislation is undeniable. The GENIUS Act&apos;s proposed
dual-oversight structure—letting smaller issuers stick with state regulators
while larger ones fall under federal watch—seems designed to balance innovation
with stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a minute there, the buzz was that
Senate Majority Leader John Thunemight
push for a full Senate vote on the GENIUS Act before Memorial Day. That talk
has quieted down a bit, making the exact timing fuzzy now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, getting any stablecoin bill signed
into law would be huge for the cryptocurrency industry. It would signal that
the US is finally getting serious about fitting digital assets into the
financial picture and could be the first domino to fall, leading to clearer
rules for other parts of crypto later on.&lt;/p&gt;

The food index fell 0.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core CPI was 2.1% annualized over the three months through April and 3.0% annualized in the six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Fed would have an easy time teeing up a cut right now if not for the tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget housing and insurance, we&apos;re onto tariff effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has shifted closer to market pricing on the ECB. They now see a 25 bps cut in June and another July, which would get them to 1.75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is still skeptical on that timeline, seeing only an 80% chance of a cut in June and a lower likelihood of a cut at the July 24 meeting. The big event to watch for is July 9, which is the expiration of the reciprocal tariff exemption. So far progress on EU-US talks has been very slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also raised its GDP forecast for the Eurozone following the US-China deal and now sees +0.1% in Q3 and Q4 vs no growth prior. That&apos;s hardly inspiring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;We will get a momentary break from the trade war today with US inflation data due at 8:30 am ET (1230 GMT). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough to say how the Fed is evaluating these data points because so much is happening so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs spiked in April but it takes some time for shipments to come through and turn into inflation. Then this week, the US dropped tariff rates on China. At the same time, OPEC production hikes and global economic gloom tanked oil prices in the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add it all up and economists are forecasting both headline and core CPI up 0.3% m/m. The y/y readings are expected at +2.4% and +2.8%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d expect some dollar volatility on the release and I can see Fed implied probabilities bouncing around. Currently we&apos;re 40% priced for a July 30 rate cut and there are 81 bps priced in for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK Employment data came out more or less in line with expectations although wage growth remains pretty high for the BoE. There&apos;s the usual trust issue with the UK employment data, so it didn&apos;t change anything in terms of market expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also got some promising signs in the soft data with the German ZEW and US NFIB surveys. Both improved as uncertainty and fears around tariffs and growth eased given the recent developments. We might see better and better data going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank officials are now starting to sound more cautious on rate cuts as fears around global growth ease and risk of a surge in demand could increase inflationary pressures, especially given that some central banks cut rates amid the trade war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Trade Representative Greer said that they are moving as quickly as they can on trade deals and basically confirmed that the goal is a 10% global tariff rate. That should decrease general uncertainty and improve economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the US CPI report coming up. The focus will be on the Core figures with the Y/Y reading expected at 2.8% vs. 2.8% prior, while the M/M measure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.1% prior. The economic data should start to gradually matter again going forward but bad data will likely be faded given the &quot;U-turn&quot; in trade policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the focus will now switch from growth back to inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will take time to end non-tariff barriers with China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will talk to the Indian commerce minister Tuesday, then flying to South Korea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are discussing other deals in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US is not relying on any trade partner for critical goods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global 10% tariff is a strong incentive to reduce the deficit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump is to consider change if we see results on fentanyl.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should now be pretty clear for everyone that the end goal is an average 10% global tariff rate. That should decrease general uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In monetary policy, it&apos;s important to be cautious and not overreact, giving undue weight to specific announcements that could change shortly afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will continue to apply a data-driven approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decisions to be taken at each meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like the hawks at the ECB are starting to get uncomfortable with the pace of rate cuts and would prefer to get more information before adjusting further.&lt;/p&gt;

remained far above the historical average of 68. Seasonally adjusted, 
34% of business owners reported job openings they could not fill in 
April, down six points from March. The last time job openings were below
 this level was in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg notes: &quot;Uncertainty continues to be a major impediment for small business owners
 in operating their business in April, affecting everything from hiring 
plans to investment decisions. While owners are still trying to fill a 
high number of current job openings, their outlook on business 
conditions is less supportive of future business investments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BoE&apos;s Pill: I do worry about upside risks to inflation in upside inflation scenario</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should not assume that latest MPR forecast is a direct endorsement of market interest rate curve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I see risk of second round effects (for inflation).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remain concerned we have seen a structural change in price and wage setting in UK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Response of monetary policy to ensure we get CPI back to target may need to be more persistent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MPR inflation forecast has become less relevant to MPC policy debate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pill, alongside Mann, voted for keeping the Bank Rate unchanged at the last policy decision. He is sounding hawkish because we haven&apos;t really seen a concrete progress in UK inflation and wage growth data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the upside inflation scenario is already playing out as growth fears in the markets ease and the BoE cut interest rates even though they haven&apos;t made much progress on underyling inflation and especially on the wage growth side. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The ranges of estimates are 
important in terms of market reaction because when the actual data deviates from the 
expectations, it creates a surprise effect. Another
 important input in market&apos;s reaction is the distribution of forecasts. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although we can have a range of 
estimates, most forecasts might be clustered on the upper bound of the 
range, so even if the data comes out inside the range of estimates but 
on the lower bound of the range, it can still create a surprise effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI Y/Y &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.5% (6%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.4% (61%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3% (31%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.2% (2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI M/M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.6% (1%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.4% (4%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.3% (58%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.2% (32%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.1% (4%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.0% (1%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core CPI Y/Y&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.0% (2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.9% (18%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.8% (62%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.7% (18%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core CPI M/M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.6% (1%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.4% (6%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.3% (66%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.2% (24%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.1% (3%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the expectations around an average 10% global tariff rate solidified and growth fears eased, the focus might switch back to inflation. The market might start to expect stronger economic activity ahead, therefore slower progress on inflation could deter the Fed from cutting rates and even lead to the market pricing in less rate cuts than previously expected. This should be supportive for the US Dollar in the short-term as Treasury yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty is weighing on investment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soft data pointing to a significant cooling in business and consumer sentiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global economic integretion is now stalled, if not reversing; last few weeks have seen an acceleration in pace and scale of change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if a full-blown trade war turns out to be short-lived, uncertainty effects will persist for some time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monetary policy must adapt to the new nature of supply shocks generated by geoeconomic fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given effects of size, scale and more persistent nature of fragmentation-induced shocks, and their impact on prices, monetary policy responses will need careful calibration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Threats of inflation de-anchoring, from both above and below, warrant forceful and persistent responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest rates remains default policy lever in our toolbox; when constrained by lower bound, other tools such as targeted lending and balance sheet operations have their uses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s suggesting a more careful approach to interest rates adjustments. I think the ECB now needs to pause for some time and see how things evolve in light of the recent news on the trade front. The market is now pricing 45 bps of easing by year-end compared to 56 bps before the US-China news.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;After the strong gains yesterday, the dollar is catching a bit of a breather in trading today. This comes as US futures are also just down slightly after the surging gains in the day before. Market players are digesting the US-China trade truce and will have to wait to see if the optimism can be justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY is down 0.4% to 147.85 but it doesn&apos;t take much away from the over 300 pips jump from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, EUR/USD is up 0.2% to 1.1115 and GBP/USD up 0.3% to 1.3215 on the day. USD/CHF is also marked down by 0.7% to 0.8395 but is still well higher compared to the Friday close last week near 0.8300. The antipodes are also faring better with AUD/USD recovering a large chunk of its losses yesterday to 0.6405 - up 0.6% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Elsewhere, gold is also seen recovering back to $3,259 and holding the line near its 1 May low of $3,201 amid the drop yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Coming up later today, we&apos;ll have the US CPI report to add to the mix. We&apos;re not likely to see any major impact from tariffs show up though, so any kneejerk reaction to the numbers should be easily brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;
