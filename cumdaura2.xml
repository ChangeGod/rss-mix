                            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT) is set to release its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings after the market closes today, Wednesday, April 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations are for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share (EPS) of $3.22,or a year-over-year increase of 9.52% (from $2.94). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revenue is projected to reach around $68.4 billion, an increase of 10.57% rise from the same period last year ($61.86 billion)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;70&quot; data-end=&quot;411&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investor attention will be firmly focused on Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, with particular interest in Azure, which is expected to post 18% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching approximately $26.1 billion. Azure’s performance continues to serve as a key barometer of Microsoft’s strength in the cloud computing space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition, Microsoft’s expanding AI portfolio—especially Microsoft 365 Copilot—remains under close scrutiny. While interest in these tools is strong, many customers are still evaluating the return on investment, and some partners have resorted to offering discounts to drive adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets will also be watching for commentary on the potential impact of tariffs and trade policy, as these could weigh on enterprise demand and global IT spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price of Microsoft is down -7.34% for the year after rising 12.09% 2024 (below the market averages). The all-time high was reached back in July 2024 at $468.35.  To the lows reached on April 7 at $344.79, the price decline was -26.28%. The price is up 13.09% from the low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The move to the upside has seen the price move back above it 50 day moving average at $386.17, giving the buyers a victory. If the price can stay above that level (currently trading at $388.38), the next key target comes against its 100-day moving average of $407.66 (+4.8% current levels). The 200 day moving averages at $414.37 (a gain of 6.7%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Break back below the 50 day moving average and traders would look toward the 38.2% retracement at $371.18 (a decline of 4.3%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers are making a play above the 50-day moving average. Will the earnings support the move and keep the momentum going?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The headliners for earnings after the close today are Meta and Microsoft and whatever they deliver on earnings will be critical for those stocks and the Nasdaq. More broadly, I&apos;ll be looking for a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Indications on AI capex, including from Qualcomm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Any guidance around the strength of the consumer, though we got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/visa-sees-no-problems-whatsoever-in-the-economy-anywhere-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;very strong comments&lt;/a&gt; from Visa yesterday and they have better data than anyone. Someone like Cheesecake Factory could have something to say, as that&apos;s a sensitive category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) CP might have some insight on the freight market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Energy companies could offer clues on capex, given low oil prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta is right after the close and MSFT is scheduled for 4:15 pm ET.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The price of WTI crude oil futures settled at $58.21. That&apos;s down -$2.21 or -3.7%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price today reached $57.94. The high price was at $60.39. The price traded to the lowest level: back to April 9. The settlement is the first below 60 since April 8. The lowest close this year was at $58.15, just below this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different reasons for the decline including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;72&quot; data-end=&quot;245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;74&quot; data-end=&quot;245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Concerns that U.S. tariff policies are slowing global growth and may push the U.S. economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;246&quot; data-end=&quot;414&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;248&quot; data-end=&quot;414&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;U.S. Q1 GDP contracted by 0.3%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis—well below the expected 0.8% growth and a sharp reversal from 2.4% growth in Q4 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;415&quot; data-end=&quot;554&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;417&quot; data-end=&quot;554&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consumer confidence has plummeted, with the index hitting its lowest level since 1990, signaling widespread concern among households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;555&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Private sector hiring sharply missed expectations, with the ADP Employment Report showing just 62,000 new jobs in April—far below the 134,000 forecast and down from 147,000 in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;744&quot; data-end=&quot;919&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;746&quot; data-end=&quot;919&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;OPEC+ is adding significant new supply, with 411,000 barrels/day set to return to market in May and more likely in June as the group unwinds its 2.2M bpd voluntary cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;920&quot; data-end=&quot;1107&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;922&quot; data-end=&quot;1107&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia is signaling readiness for a “prolonged period of low prices”, aiming to regain market share and retaliate against countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq for overproducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only positive today was that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1108&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1110&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Oil inventories unexpectedly declined, with the EIA reporting a 2.7M barrel draw last week vs. expectations for a 0.39M barrel build, but the bullish signal was overshadowed by broader macro and supply-side pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, the low price for the year – are going back to February 2021 reached $55.15 on April 7. There is no below support between the current level and that level.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;517&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NASDAQ index saw sharp selling in the first hour of trading today, dropping nearly 500 points to a session low of 16,959.53. At the lows, the index was nearing key support from the 200-hour moving average (currently at 16,940) and the rising 50-hour moving average (around 16,959). Buyers stepped in at those levels, halting the decline and sparking a rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;519&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The recovery has since pushed the index above a key swing level at 17,238.24, shifting the focus back to the 50% retracement of the move down from the December 2024 all-time high. That midpoint stands at 17,494.31. Yesterday, the index briefly moved above this level but failed to hold the gains into the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1030&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Near-term risk now sits at 17,238.24. Stronger support remains at the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. A break below both would shift control back to sellers and undermine the bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This is just crossing now, it should be good for risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuyuantantian is a Chinese social media account affiliated with  China Central Television (CCTV). It operates generally on Weibo and has reported on China&apos;s stance regarding US tariffs before and generally reflects state-sanctioned views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this might be a legitimate sign that real de-escalation talks are ongoing. That said, there has been semi-credible reporting that&apos;s said the same since the G20 last week and Trump himself has said they&apos;re talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t exactly sound like some kind of looming breakthough but it says: The US reached out to talk, China is willing to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says Carney will come to the White House within the next week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s tentatively a good sign. USD/CAD is at the lows of the day, down 35 pips to 1.3798.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump says Mark Carney will visit the White House &quot;within the next week, or less.&quot; He says Carney told him &quot;let&apos;s make a deal&quot; during their phone call yesterday. &quot;He couldn&apos;t have been nicer. He&apos;s a very nice gentleman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump dismissed Carney&apos;s &quot;betrayal&quot; line as electioneering. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to have a great relationship,&quot; he says. &quot;He was running for office. They both hated Trump -- and it was the one that hated Trump the least, I think, that won.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s bizarre that we live in a world where this is market moving stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The initial estimate for Q2 growth from the Atlanta Fed GDP model is estimated at 2.4%. The Q1 GDP was released morning with the first Guinness at -0.3%. The gold adjusted estimate from the Atlanta Fed estimate of -1.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their own words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The initial GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2025 is 2.4 percent on April 30. The initial estimate of first-quarter real GDP growth released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis this morning was -0.3 percent, 2.4 percentage points above the final GDPNow estimate of -2.7 percent growth and 1.2 percentage points above the final gold-adjusted model nowcast. As explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlantafed.org/blogs/macroblog/2025/04/23/the-switch-changing-conditions-behind-new-gdpnow-model&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the gold-adjusted model replaces what was the standard model with the onset of today’s forecast.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next GDPNow update is Thursday, May 1.

                            &lt;p&gt;Major European indices are closing with results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany today, a slew of economic data needed a mixed picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Preliminary figures from Destatis showed that annual inflation eased slightly to 2.1% in April from 2.2% in March, though it came in just above the consensus estimate of 2.0%. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the economy showed modest signs of recovery, with GDP expanding by 0.2% in the first quarter—rebounding from a 0.2% contraction in the previous quarter. Despite this improvement, analysts at ING warned that Germany could still face a rare third consecutive year of mild recession, stressing that economic revitalization should be a top priority for the incoming government. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the labor market, the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.3% from 6.2%, while the number of unemployed rose by 4,000—well below both the prior increase of 26,000 and the expected 20,000.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A summary of the closing levels shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +0.32%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, +0.50%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100, +0.37%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.59%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB -0.71%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As European traders exit for the day, US stocks or rebounding in trading the highest levels for the day but still down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -178 points or -0.44%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index point at 44 points or -0.79%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -200 points or -1.16%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US debt market, yields are mixed: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.635%, -2.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.761%, -0.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.177%, +0.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.674%, +2.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;There were rumors yesterday that India was close to the finish line and that makes sense because deals can be passed without parliament there but I don&apos;t know if the market has the patience for what&apos;s shaping up.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;139&quot; data-end=&quot;418&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is pushing to fresh lows for the day—and for the week—after breaking below Monday’s low at 1.3287. With bearish momentum building, the next downside targets include last week’s low at 1.1307, followed by a key support zone on the daily chart between 1.1271 and 1.1275.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1.1271 level marks the 61.8% retracement of the move up from the 2020 low, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1.1275 corresponds to the high from July 2023. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A break of that zone would be technically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;608&quot; data-end=&quot;854&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding to the bearish bias, the price has moved further away from both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages. Yesterday, the 100-hour MA acted as support, but today’s rally attempt stalled just short of the 200-hour MA—now reinforcing resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;From Reuters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Saudi officials in recent weeks have briefed allies and industry exports, telling they the Kingdom can sustain a prolonged period of low oil prices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is down on the headline. The context here is that Saudis are trying to threaten countries that aren&apos;t complying with quotas and/or overproduction payback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could all come to a head on May 5 with the scheduled OPEC meeting but the oil market isn&apos;t waiting as it&apos;s quickly down $1.50 on this report.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a choppy day in the foreign exchange market, which isn&apos;t unusual at month-end, particularly in a very volatile month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar had been slackening in the last hour broadly but there is some life in stocks now and the dollar has rebounded. At the same time, the euro is particularly soft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough to tie this back to newsflow as it as generally dovish today, which should hurt the US dollar. The market is taking a recessionary view with 132 bps in easing in the year ahead now priced in, compared to 125 bps yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the market is trying to suss out what is coming in the trade war and there is no sign of a breakthough with China. That could happen fast but there is a line of thinking that it won&apos;t happen unless stock markets go back to the lows. Today, Trump was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-blames-biden-says-to-be-patient-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; Americans to &apos;be patient&apos; which isn&apos;t exactly comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The comments from the Visa conference call regarding the consumer and the global macroeconomy were really something. They highlight that consumers are employed and that, as long as they remain that way, they&apos;re going to keep on spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some direct quotes from executives on the call:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&quot;In Q2 and through April 21, we have not seen any signs of overall consumer spending weakening.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&quot;While spending growth differs among consumer spend bands, with the most affluent growing the fastest, all spend bands remain resilient and consistent with past quarters.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&quot;Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend remains strong.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Consumer spending shows resilience &quot;in an uncertain and dynamic environment.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&quot;Outside the U.S., we see similar stable trends.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&quot;Within cross-border, volume growth was in line with Q4 2024 levels.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&quot;We have seen some impacts from currency weakness and travel to specific countries, but the overall growth was above the pre-COVID trend.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel and US-Canada travel was down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&quot;Within spend categories, there are some select areas such as in travel with airlines and lodging where growth has decelerated.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&quot;We saw travel and entertainment growth decelerate, restaurant growth remained stable and retail and fuel growth improved.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;whitespace-normal break-words&quot; index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&quot;We did see a meaningful slowdown in the Canada to U.S. border.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty, yes but impacts unclear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;There&apos;s obviously more uncertainty today among consumers and businesses than there was several months ago. You see that in the consumer confidence metrics.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When asked about de minimis exemption tariffs related to China: &quot;So far, we&apos;re not seeing a material impact from tariffs related to China.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an incredible divergence between consumer confidence and spending at the moment and that helps to explain why stock markets have rallied despite the trade war. That said, US equities were incredibly resilient just weeks before the March 2020 covid shutdowns even as the cases were spreading abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other take here could be that Americans spent money ahead of tariffs and Visa misinterpreted that as a sign of consumer strength.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;168&quot; data-end=&quot;399&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD attempted to push higher yesterday, briefly breaking above a key swing area near 0.6430–0.6442. However, the breakout quickly failed, and the price reversed lower—signaling a bull trap and a shift in short-term momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;401&quot; data-end=&quot;668&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The reversal led to a decisive break below both the 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (0.6390–0.6398), a zone that had previously acted as a ceiling (see red circles). That area is now reestablished as resistance, and staying below keeps the short-term bias tilted to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;670&quot; data-end=&quot;832&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With momentum favoring sellers, the next key support target lies between 0.63216 and 0.63437—an area defined by prior swing levels and recent consolidation zones. Moving below that level, opens the door for more downside probing with the 100-day MA at 0.62814 as another key level . The price moved above the 100 day MA back on April 14. After trading above and below the level control pushing price to the high of 0.6438 on April 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;864&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;865&quot; data-end=&quot;1005&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;865&quot; data-end=&quot;961&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;867&quot; data-end=&quot;961&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6390–0.6398 (broken MAs and ceiling), 0.6430–0.6442 (failed swing high area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;962&quot; data-end=&quot;1005&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;964&quot; data-end=&quot;1005&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support/Target: 0.63216 to 0.63437 (swing area). 0.62814 (100 day moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1007&quot; data-end=&quot;1153&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traders will be watching for continued momentum toward the lower support area as long as the pair remains capped below the broken moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;&quot;I Do as the President Says&quot;: Musk&apos;s Edgy Pulse Check on Federal Employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment dripping with Muskian wit at President Trump&apos;s live Cabinet meeting today, Elon Musk, not shy of controversy, explained the blunt reasoning behind his recent email &quot;pulse check&quot; to the federal workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse and two neurons?&quot; Musk asked rhetorically, laying out what he described as a surprisingly &quot;low bar&quot; for federal employees: merely responding to an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re simply trying to figure out if these people exist,&quot; Musk quipped. &quot;We suspect some on the payroll might literally be fictional or deceased.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a roughly 50% response rate from the estimated two million federal workers, Musk&apos;s humorous tone underscored a stark reality: non-responsive employees might soon find themselves without a paycheck. &quot;It’s not a high bar, guys,&quot; Musk reminded, emphasizing taxpayer expectations. &quot;Can they at least write an email?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked directly if non-responsive employees faced termination, Musk sidestepped exact numbers but offered clarity on expectations: &quot;If the job isn&apos;t essential or isn&apos;t being done well, then yes, those roles shouldn&apos;t be funded by taxpayers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk&apos;s directive emerged from a direct request by President Trump, who personally instructed him to be &quot;more aggressive&quot; in handling the sprawling bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, sir, Mr. President,&quot; Musk recalled his response, smiling. &quot;I do as the President says.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all agencies seem to have taken the message seriously, with some instructing their staff the email was &quot;voluntary.&quot; Musk dismissed this, signaling another round of emails incoming, aimed at achieving full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not complicated,&quot; Musk said, &quot;just reply—even if it&apos;s to say your work is too sensitive to discuss. Common sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech titan&apos;s blunt approach highlights an edgy yet serious debate: How many jobs in Washington are truly necessary? Musk insists the goal isn&apos;t arbitrary firings but accountability. His humorous yet sharp-edged commentary might be exactly what taxpayers want to hear—someone finally asking, &quot;Are these people even real?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from Musk and Trump is clear: if federal workers can&apos;t prove they&apos;re alive and actively contributing, their government jobs might soon be extinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ForexLive.com will become &lt;a href=&quot;https://investinglive.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;investingLive.com&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market paints a troubling picture today, with red dominating the heatmap. The technology sector is notably weak, marked by significant losses. Leading the decline is Microsoft (MSFT) at -1.32%, and Oracle (ORCL) sliding by -2.34%. The semiconductor industry is bleeding as well, with Nvidia (NVDA) experiencing a drop of 2.77%, which underscores a bearish mood for chipmakers today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the consumer defensive sector stands resilient, providing a refuge amid widespread selling. Key players like Walmart (WMT) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) saw minor dips at -0.43% and -0.91% respectively, but outperformed other sectors, underscoring their traditional safe-haven appeal during turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall sentiment is skittish with cautious investors navigating the wary waters. High-profile tech stocks are feeling the squeeze as uncertainty looms over continued interest rate hikes and global supply chain concerns. This cautious mood has shifted some focus onto stable, dividend-rich defensive stocks, which are faring better today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there’s a mixed performance in the financial sector as well: although JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is down 1.66%, Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) show more restrained declines at -0.48% and -0.43% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investors deliberating over adjustments in their portfolios, today&apos;s market dynamics suggest a strategic shift could be prudent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek Shelter in Consumer Defensive Stocks: Their relative stability in this turbulent environment makes them an attractive choice for risk-averse investors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor Tech Sector Developments: With potential for rebound, tech stocks that are currently underperforming could offer attractive entry points once market conditions stabilize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversify Across Sectors: In stark market conditions like today’s, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks and capture opportunities across different sectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay current with market updates and consider visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for incisive viewpoints and analyses.

      <title>GBPUSD retreats after false break of 2024 high — sellers regain short-term control</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;186&quot; data-end=&quot;429&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the GBPUSD reached a fresh high of 1.34413—its strongest level since February 2022—but the rally stalled just 7-8 pips above the 2024 high at 1.3433. That failed break marked a turning point, and sellers have since regained control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;431&quot; data-end=&quot;831&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the hourly chart, the price action today has shifted more definitively to the downside. After testing and briefly bouncing off the 200-hour moving average (now at 1.33405), GBPUSD fell back below both the 200-hour and 100-hour MAs (the latter at 1.33547), turning those levels into short-term risk zones for sellers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;431&quot; data-end=&quot;831&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The break of the prior day’s low and support at 1.33784 further tilted momentum lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;833&quot; data-end=&quot;1016&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Staying below both moving averages keeps the short-term bearish bias intact. Traders will now look for continued downside momentum, with key support levels eyed at 1.33221 and 1.3300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1018&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the daily chart, the failure to hold above the 2024 high reinforces the significance of the 1.3433 level. Unless buyers can reclaim that zone, the broader breakout attempt risks fading further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1221&quot; data-end=&quot;1246&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.33547 (100-hour MA), 1.33405 (200-hour MA), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3292 (swing high from April 16)., 1.32328 (low from last week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

There is also the OPEC decision on May 5 that could submarine the market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US and Ukraine ran into last-minute hurdles on Wednesday as they were on the verge of signing a framework minerals deal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/1ae70f6c-6651-46e4-bc14-cfd6befc1474&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the FT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said that Ukraine had sought to revisit terms agreed on the weekend but it could still be signed if Ukraine returned to the original terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Ukraine said that nothing can be signed because it must be ratified by parliament first.&lt;/p&gt;
