Equities also made a huge comeback from -2% to flat. That&apos;s the kind of move you would expect on positive trade news but there wasn&apos;t much, aside from a Chinese report saying that US officials had called to talk, and most of the moves came before that report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Month end is an obvious culprit and a convincing one. Some might point to higher inflation in the GDP report as a catalyst but the PCE data showed a decelerating trend in the quarter with core PCE at +0.337%
in January, +0.498% in February, and +0.028% in March. In addition, oil prices just wrapped up a catastrophic month, which is deflationary pressure. Still, lower inflation is hardly a USD catalyst, unless your main worry is that the Fed is so far behind the curve that a brutal recession looms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loonie got a lift from Trump&apos;s positive comments about Carney and the planned visit with the newly-elected Canadian PM. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg with the news snippet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU to present new trade proposals to US negotiators next week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is gated, but the gist of it is that the European Union is set to unveil fresh trade proposals to U.S. negotiators next week. Although the specifics are still undisclosed, the renewed talks come at a time of heightened global trade tensions, with both sides aiming to resolve disputes over tariffs and regulatory issues. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson recently noted that any final deal is still &quot;some weeks away,&quot; pointing to continued negotiations ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ reports comments from Senator Lindsay Graham:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he has 60 co-sponsors of bill to put secondary sanctions on Russian oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predicts that number will rise to at least 67&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“It’s clear to me—and I think it’s becoming clear to President Trump—that the Russians are playing games,” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bill would put 500% sanctions on buyers of Russian oil, gas, uranium or other products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thune has made no promises to bring the bill to a vote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 67 it would be veto-proof, meaning that Trump couldn&apos;t stop it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, this looks like posturing and leverage in an attempt to get Russia to negotiate peace. If this were to happen, it would materially change the balance of the global oil market and spike prices.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;What could&apos;ve been a horrible month for major indices is ending up mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading month, the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average still fell -3.18%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the S&amp;amp;P only declined by -0.77%, while the NASDAQ index rose by 0.85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading day, the major indices staged a rally into the close. Both the Dow and the S&amp;amp;P closed higher but the NASDAQ index had a modest decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final numbers are showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average rose 141.74 points or 0.35% at 40669.36. The intraday low took the index down -782 points before reversing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index closed higher by 8.19 points or 0.15% at 5569.02. The intraday low was down -127.59 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index fell by -14.98 points or -0.09% at 17446.34 . The intraday low was down -501.79 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Meta earnings after the close&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan is expected to leave policy ucnahged today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is always the case with Bank of Japan meetings there is no set time for the statement. Experience suggests 0230 to 0330 GMT ( 2230 - 2330 US Eastern time) is a reasonable time to expect it. What is known re timing is that Ueda&apos;s press conference will begin at 0630 GMT (0230 US Eastern time).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT) is set to release its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings after the market closes today, Wednesday, April 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations are for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share (EPS) of $3.22,or a year-over-year increase of 9.52% (from $2.94). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revenue is projected to reach around $68.4 billion, an increase of 10.57% rise from the same period last year ($61.86 billion)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;70&quot; data-end=&quot;411&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investor attention will be firmly focused on Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, with particular interest in Azure, which is expected to post 18% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching approximately $26.1 billion. Azure’s performance continues to serve as a key barometer of Microsoft’s strength in the cloud computing space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition, Microsoft’s expanding AI portfolio—especially Microsoft 365 Copilot—remains under close scrutiny. While interest in these tools is strong, many customers are still evaluating the return on investment, and some partners have resorted to offering discounts to drive adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets will also be watching for commentary on the potential impact of tariffs and trade policy, as these could weigh on enterprise demand and global IT spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price of Microsoft is down -7.34% for the year after rising 12.09% 2024 (below the market averages). The all-time high was reached back in July 2024 at $468.35.  To the lows reached on April 7 at $344.79, the price decline was -26.28%. The price is up 13.09% from the low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The move to the upside has seen the price move back above it 50 day moving average at $386.17, giving the buyers a victory. If the price can stay above that level (currently trading at $388.38), the next key target comes against its 100-day moving average of $407.66 (+4.8% current levels). The 200 day moving averages at $414.37 (a gain of 6.7%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Break back below the 50 day moving average and traders would look toward the 38.2% retracement at $371.18 (a decline of 4.3%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;872&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers are making a play above the 50-day moving average. Will the earnings support the move and keep the momentum going?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The headliners for earnings after the close today are Meta and Microsoft and whatever they deliver on earnings will be critical for those stocks and the Nasdaq. More broadly, I&apos;ll be looking for a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Indications on AI capex, including from Qualcomm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Any guidance around the strength of the consumer, though we got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/visa-sees-no-problems-whatsoever-in-the-economy-anywhere-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;very strong comments&lt;/a&gt; from Visa yesterday and they have better data than anyone. Someone like Cheesecake Factory could have something to say, as that&apos;s a sensitive category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) CP might have some insight on the freight market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Energy companies could offer clues on capex, given low oil prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta is right after the close and MSFT is scheduled for 4:15 pm ET.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The price of WTI crude oil futures settled at $58.21. That&apos;s down -$2.21 or -3.7%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price today reached $57.94. The high price was at $60.39. The price traded to the lowest level: back to April 9. The settlement is the first below 60 since April 8. The lowest close this year was at $58.15, just below this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different reasons for the decline including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;72&quot; data-end=&quot;245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;74&quot; data-end=&quot;245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Concerns that U.S. tariff policies are slowing global growth and may push the U.S. economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;246&quot; data-end=&quot;414&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;248&quot; data-end=&quot;414&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;U.S. Q1 GDP contracted by 0.3%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis—well below the expected 0.8% growth and a sharp reversal from 2.4% growth in Q4 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;415&quot; data-end=&quot;554&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;417&quot; data-end=&quot;554&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consumer confidence has plummeted, with the index hitting its lowest level since 1990, signaling widespread concern among households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;555&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Private sector hiring sharply missed expectations, with the ADP Employment Report showing just 62,000 new jobs in April—far below the 134,000 forecast and down from 147,000 in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;744&quot; data-end=&quot;919&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;746&quot; data-end=&quot;919&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;OPEC+ is adding significant new supply, with 411,000 barrels/day set to return to market in May and more likely in June as the group unwinds its 2.2M bpd voluntary cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;920&quot; data-end=&quot;1107&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;922&quot; data-end=&quot;1107&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia is signaling readiness for a “prolonged period of low prices”, aiming to regain market share and retaliate against countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq for overproducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only positive today was that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1108&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1110&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Oil inventories unexpectedly declined, with the EIA reporting a 2.7M barrel draw last week vs. expectations for a 0.39M barrel build, but the bullish signal was overshadowed by broader macro and supply-side pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, the low price for the year – are going back to February 2021 reached $55.15 on April 7. There is no below support between the current level and that level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NASDAQ rebounds after early plunge; eyes key resistance at 50% midpoint</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;517&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NASDAQ index saw sharp selling in the first hour of trading today, dropping nearly 500 points to a session low of 16,959.53. At the lows, the index was nearing key support from the 200-hour moving average (currently at 16,940) and the rising 50-hour moving average (around 16,959). Buyers stepped in at those levels, halting the decline and sparking a rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;519&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The recovery has since pushed the index above a key swing level at 17,238.24, shifting the focus back to the 50% retracement of the move down from the December 2024 all-time high. That midpoint stands at 17,494.31. Yesterday, the index briefly moved above this level but failed to hold the gains into the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1030&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Near-term risk now sits at 17,238.24. Stronger support remains at the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. A break below both would shift control back to sellers and undermine the bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This is just crossing now, it should be good for risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuyuantantian is a Chinese social media account affiliated with  China Central Television (CCTV). It operates generally on Weibo and has reported on China&apos;s stance regarding US tariffs before and generally reflects state-sanctioned views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this might be a legitimate sign that real de-escalation talks are ongoing. That said, there has been semi-credible reporting that&apos;s said the same since the G20 last week and Trump himself has said they&apos;re talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t exactly sound like some kind of looming breakthough but it says: The US reached out to talk, China is willing to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

USD/CAD is at the lows of the day, down 35 pips to 1.3798.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump says Mark Carney will visit the White House &quot;within the next week, or less.&quot; He says Carney told him &quot;let&apos;s make a deal&quot; during their phone call yesterday. &quot;He couldn&apos;t have been nicer. He&apos;s a very nice gentleman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump dismissed Carney&apos;s &quot;betrayal&quot; line as electioneering. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to have a great relationship,&quot; he says. &quot;He was running for office. They both hated Trump -- and it was the one that hated Trump the least, I think, that won.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s bizarre that we live in a world where this is market moving stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those favoring no change wanted to gain more info on US tariffs, backed a wait-and-see approach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members favoring a cut cited muted near-term inflation risks and signs of economic weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those favoring a cut highlighted need for timely action, given lags&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone agreed there was a great deal of uncertainty and the situation could change quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed they should be less forward-looking than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed to maintain a robust survey and outreach plan to better understand in real time how the economy was adapting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed it was difficult to predict opposing pressure on prices beyond April&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
