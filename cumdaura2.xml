“US businesses and consumers become the price-takers... it is the dollar that needs to weaken to adjust if supply chains and/or consumers are relatively inelastic in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1744&quot; data-end=&quot;1964&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1746&quot; data-end=&quot;1964&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On a proposed 10% universal tariff: “This is far from guaranteed, but it is newly possible...

This could be to other businesses (intermediate consumption) or to final consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cover various industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services, among others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rising PPI Outputs index can indicate increasing inflationary pressure as producers are getting higher prices for their goods and services. However, they might not necessarily pass these increases on to consumers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;PPI Inputs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The PPI Inputs, on the other hand, measure the average prices paid by New Zealand producers for their inputs — the raw materials, services, and capital goods they use to produce their goods and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These inputs can be sourced domestically or imported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the PPI Inputs index is rising, it suggests that producers are facing higher costs, which might eventually lead to higher prices for consumers if the producers pass these costs on through higher output prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;New Zealand services PMI, the BusinessNZ Performance of Services Index, for April 2025, 48.5 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;down from March&apos;s 49.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;well below the average of 53.0 over the history of the survey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
BusinessNZ’s CEO, Katherine Rich said the sector has fallen back into a pattern of mild contraction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNZ’s Senior Economist Doug Steel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“for all the commentary around the economic recovery, the PSI is a good reminder that current conditions are extremely challenging. New Zealand’s PSI remains weaker than all our key trading partners. At 48.5, it’s consistent with a service sector still moving backwards”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/new-zealand-april-manufacturing-pmi-shows-an-uptick-in-expansion-to-539-vs-prior-532-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;New Zealand April Manufacturing PMI shows an uptick in expansion to 53.9 vs. prior 53.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The speech listed from Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams is a commencement address before the Hofstra University Graduate Commencement, in Hempstead, N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2120 GMT / 1720 US Eastern time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far there hasn&apos;t been anything crossing news wires on this. It seems an unlikely venue for a policy-related speech, so its not surprising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note on the calendar otherwise is data from China. Consensus estimates are for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;retail sales to dip from March&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fixed-asset investment to remain steady&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;industrial production also to dip (April purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data, along with trade data, point to a lower result for industrial output)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Dan is pro-EU and pro-NATO. EUR/USD is a little higher than its Friday close as I update. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yen is higher also, seemingly attracting a safe haven bid after another downgrade for the US lat on Friday. USD/JPY is circa 145.32 as I update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody&apos;s downgraded its US rating from &apos;AAA&apos; to &apos;Aa1&apos;. Moody&apos;s had held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Moody&apos;s noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moody&apos;s was late to this game, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings did so in &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US Treasury Secretary Bessent spoke with CNN on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was forthright with his threat to foreign countries that Trump&apos;s tariff will jump back a “reciprocal” level if trade deals are not reached with the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Trump has put them on notice that if you do not negotiate in good faith, you will ratchet back up to your April 2 level”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bessent touted that there are incoming deals with 18 &quot;important&quot; trading partners but didn&apos;t indicate a timeline for these&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll recall Trump&apos;s tariffs were greeted with shock, with rates up to 30%, 40%, 50%, depending on country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;were scheduled to take effect on April 9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;after markets collapsed Trump was forced into a backdown, pausing tariffs for 90 days to allow negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;more to come &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Biden will be reviewing treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wish him well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement from Biden&apos;s office:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Official results from half of polling stations showed Dan with around 50.5% of votes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exit polls published right
after voting ended had him at 54-55%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Dan is pro-EU and NATO, unlike the far-right candidate he was up against. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The election in Romania took place nearly six months after the initial
ballot was cancelled because of alleged Russian interference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan&apos;s victory is a win for stability in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voting in Romania took place on the same day as the first
round of a Polish election&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;liberal frontrunner Trzaskowski has moved ahead of ahead of Nawrocki, the
candidate backed by the opposition nationalist Law and Justice
(PiS) party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The weekend started off with a bang as the US credit rating was downgraded by Moody&apos;s late in the day. That will start things on a soft footing but a few developments afterwards also aren&apos;t promising:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Bessent&apos;s reaction to the downgrade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he campaigned for the job of Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent repeatedly highlighted the poor US fiscal trajectory as his defining reason for taking the jobs. Something about politics seems to have changed that. In an interview today he said he wouldn&apos;t put much creedence in Moody&apos;s. He also said that GDP growth will outrun the deficit, bringing down debt-to-GDP. That&apos;s a laughable idea with deficits set to run at +7% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point here is that no one in charge seems to care about the deficit and Bessent is now downplaying the problem. Maybe some hawks in Congress stand up but I wouldn&apos;t bet on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) What happened to capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bessent also said that Walmart is going to eat some of the tariffs after Trump took a straight-up socialist turn with this post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that would destroy corporate profits. Walmart is one of the all-time great examples of the power of capitalism. It generated $648.1 billion in sales globally last year and earned $15.5 billion. That&apos;s a 2.4% margin. Moreover, some of the lowest-margin items they sell (ex-groceries) are made in China, like electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Bessent said Liberation Day tariffs will be reinstated for many countries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last week, the FT reported that Japan has cut off negotiations on tariffs until after July elections. So far we have one &apos;deal&apos; with the UK and weeks of rumors about other deals that haven&apos;t come to fruition. Where are the countries that are willing to tolerate 10% tariffs? Lately there is a report that the US and EU have exchanged some negotiating documents but I think it&apos;s a fantasy that the US will get away with a 10% tariff floor and open up more trade without retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade war isn&apos;t over, it&apos;s on a break.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The UK Times (gated) interview with Prime Minister Starmer. From the report (bolding is mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The prime minister is expected to ­announce broad plans for a youth mobility deal on Monday as part of a wider agreement with the European Union&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deal will bring Britain into the closest alignment with the EU since Brexit and will cover trade, agriculture, security and defence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Starmer said that the deal, to be ­announced at a meeting at Lancaster House in London, would be a “really ­significant moment”. He added that the effects would be “measured in the ­pockets of working people” in the form of better job prospects and higher living standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, The Times is gated but the link to the article is above. There is a lot more detail, if you can access it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other reports that are not gated, but since the interview was with The Times they are not as detailed. Link here though:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Sky) &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmer-says-closer-eu-ties-will-be-good-for-uk-jobs-bills-and-borders-ahead-of-key-talks-13370004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The government is set to host EU leaders in London on Monday as part of its efforts to &quot;reset&quot; relations post-Brexit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(BBC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c706e6nxwr4o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;As well as youth mobility, issues such as fishing rights are also expected to be discussed during Monday&apos;s meeting - the first since Brexit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starmer added that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Nobody wants to relitigate the last nine years&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOL. There are plenty of folks in the UK doing just that. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt; Australian Prime Minister Albanese responded to questions from media, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/albanese-backs-aussie-prosecco-feta-makers-ahead-of-eu-trade-talks-20250517-p5m023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt; (gated) , on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;will attend Pope Leo XIV’s inauguration mass in Rome &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;will meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the sidelines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;will renew leader-level discussions for an Australia-European free trade deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australia would not strike a deal with the EU “at any price”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;but, 
“We’re up for a deal that’s in Australia’s national interest”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Albanese pointed to the Australia-UK free trade deal as a template for a good deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations for a free trade agreement with Europe stalled in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s counterintuitive, but justified by the uncertainty and loss of confidence in US policies among certain segments of the financial markets.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;607&quot; data-end=&quot;890&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagarde framed this as an opportunity for Europe to strengthen integration citing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the bloc’s perceived stability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;independent central bank&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;credible institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Comparing the EU with the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“At a time when we see the rule of law, the judicial system, and trade rules being called into question in the US... Europe is rightly perceived as a stable economic and political area”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagarde noted the need for efforts to create a unified capital market, saying that their is a &quot;groundswell&quot; of support for this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I know Lagarde is talking her book, but proclaiming Europe as a stable political arena is a bit of a stretch. Comments welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I think perhaps she should have mentioned the role Germany&apos;s fiscal bonanza played in EUR gains earlier this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-removal-of-the-german-debt-brake-is-a-gamechanger-20250305/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;The removal of the German debt brake is a gamechanger
Europe is ready to spend again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reaction from financial markets is unequivocal on the new German government proposal to lift the debt brake and spending as much as 500 billion euros on infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, there are some moves in weekend markets. Weekend markets are very, very thin and illiquid. Its hard to emphasise how thin and illiquid. Take care reading too much into them.

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The recent decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to accept a luxurious Boeing 747-8 airplane valued at approximately $400 million from Qatar has ignited significant controversy in the United States, drawing legal, ethical, and political scrutiny. Many are asking: Is it legal for Trump to accept the airplane gift?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qartar&apos;s Airplane Gift and Its Status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatar presented the airplane to President Trump during his recent visit to the Gulf state, prompting questions such as &quot;Why did Qatar gift Trump an airplane?&quot; The luxurious aircraft, intended for use as Air Force One, has already arrived in the United States and is currently grounded at San Antonio International Airport. Preliminary retrofitting work is reportedly underway, preparing the jet for potential official use as Air Force One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal Concerns: Foreign Emoluments Clause and Congressional Approval&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the controversy is the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which explicitly prohibits any federal official, including the President, from accepting gifts from foreign states without explicit consent from Congress. Legal analysis suggests that regardless of whether the airplane is intended for personal or government use, accepting such an extravagant gift without congressional approval seems to directly conflict with constitutional requirements. People are specifically searching for &quot;Foreign Emoluments Clause Trump airplane&quot; and asking, &quot;Is Trump violating Constitution by accepting Qatar jet?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political and Ethical Opposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue has triggered substantial bipartisan criticism. Democratic legislators have initiated congressional investigations into Trump&apos;s Qatar airplane gift, demanding transparency and legal justification from both the Department of Justice and White House Counsel. Several Republican lawmakers have joined the chorus, voicing concerns over national security risks and the ethical implications, with public and political figures openly discussing &quot;Who opposes Trump airplane gift from Qatar?&quot; and &quot;Bipartisan criticism Trump Qatar airplane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethics watchdogs and advocacy groups emphasize that allowing the gift sets a troubling precedent, potentially undermining public trust in government institutions and raising severe concerns over potential foreign influence in U.S. politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Status of Opposition and Current Actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, opposition is gaining momentum through congressional investigations led by the House Judiciary Committee. Legal experts anticipate swift legal action and possible lawsuits against Trump&apos;s airplane gift if President Trump attempts to officially utilize the aircraft without obtaining congressional consent. Such actions could include lawsuits filed by congressional representatives or ethics advocacy organizations aimed at securing injunctions against the use of the jet pending comprehensive judicial review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected Next Moves and Predictions: Will courts block Trump from using Qatar airplane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If President Trump proceeds to officially use the airplane, opponents are expected to immediately seek legal intervention through the courts, prompting questions like, &quot;Will courts block Trump from using Qatar airplane?&quot; Initial measures would likely include filing motions for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions to halt any official use of the plane. This would force the matter into expedited judicial review, ensuring quick clarification on the legality of accepting the gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, congressional leaders will likely call urgent hearings regarding Trump&apos;s Qatar airplane congressional hearings to address constitutional and national security implications, putting further political pressure on the administration to either formally seek congressional approval or reconsider acceptance of the gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the Outcome as President Trump Remains Firm to Accept the Airplane Gift from Qatar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the clear wording of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause and strong bipartisan concerns, opponents of the airplane&apos;s acceptance appear to have significant leverage. Historically, courts have generally supported strict interpretations of constitutional clauses designed to prevent conflicts of interest and foreign influence. Therefore, it is a well-founded estimation—though not guaranteed—that legal challenges could successfully halt the airplane’s official use unless explicit congressional authorization is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while President Trump remains firm in his stance, the likelihood of opponents successfully requiring formal congressional approval remains high, reflecting constitutional clarity, bipartisan political alignment, and historical judicial precedent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis is an estimation based on current available legal opinions, political dynamics, and historical precedents, emphasizing the necessity of formal congressional consent for high-value gifts from foreign entities. It is not a formal legal analysis. Always do your own reseach.

                            &lt;p&gt;European Central Bank Board Member Schnabel spoke on Saturday, expressing a cautious approach to further rate cuts. Schnabel cited lingering uncertainties from global trade tensions and inflation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“We need to maintain a steady hand for now”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;warned that falling energy prices and slowing global growth may lower inflation in the short term but could reverse in the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We can leave rates broadly at the level they are at now and are confident that we can also maintain price stability in this way.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June&apos;s decision (the Bank meet on the 4th and 5th, markets are expecting a rate cut) Schnabel refrained from confirming her outright support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“It’s to be seen what will happen” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnabel remarked also on the euro’s recent appreciation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We now have a historic opportunity to further strengthen the international role of the euro”. To support that goal she reiterated the need for a unified European bond market and revisiting the idea of joint debt issuance. “I do think that it’s not fundamentally wrong to also think about joint debt to finance public goods in Europe”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnabel made similar &apos;steady hand&apos; comments earlier last week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ecb-should-keep-steady-hand-hold-rates-close-current-levels-schnabel-says-2025-05-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ECB should keep steady hand, hold rates close to current levels, Schnabel says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Latvian central bank governor, and therefore a Governing Council member of the European Central Bank, Martins Kazaks spoke on Friday with CNBC, ICYMI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, he said on Friday that interest rates may be close to their terminal level, though uncertainty remains high and further changes to the policy outlook are possible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“We are, by and large, within the baseline scenario” (the ECB inflation target is 2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“And if the baseline scenario holds, then I think we are relatively close to the terminal rate already”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;a couple of more cuts may be possible&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazaks said the outlook will depend on incoming data on developments in the economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is to see where the trade talk and the trade story take us, and then of course we&apos;ll act” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazaks expressed a similar view around three weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/ecbs-kazaks-urges-caution-on-further-european-centralbank-rate-cuts-20250427/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ECB&apos;s Kazaks urges caution on further European Central Bank rate cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank monetary policy Governing Council meets next on June 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mon: Canadian Holiday (Victoria Day), EU-UK Summit; Chinese Industrial Output (Apr), Retail Sales (Apr), House Prices (Apr), EZ HICP Final (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tue: PBoC LPR, RBA Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Financial Stability Report; EZ Current Account (Mar), Consumer Confidence Flash (May), Canadian CPI (Apr), German PPI (Apr), New Zealand Trade (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wed: Japanese Trade Balance (Apr),UK CPI (Apr), US MBA (w/e 12th May)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thu: ECB Minutes (Apr), CBRT Inflation Report; Australian Flash PMIs (May), Japanese Flash PMIs (May), UK PNSB (Apr), EZ, UK &amp;amp; US Flash PMIs (May), US Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 17th May), Canadian PPI (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fri: EZ Negotiated Wage Rates (Q1), Japanese CPI (Apr), German Detailed GDP (Q1), UK Retail Sales (Apr), US New Home Sales (Apr), Canadian Retail Sales (Mar)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-UK Summit (Mon):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives are meeting in London for a Brexit reset summit. Ahead of the gathering, the European Council has outlined the bloc’s priorities as defence/security. As usual for such meetings, fishing and youth mobility will draw significant headline attention and often serve as a barometer for the tone of talks, as they are typically the issues with the greatest divergence of views. The EU is sending Commission President von der Leyen, Council President Costa and diplomat Kallas to the summit. From the UK, PM Starmer will be the main representative. Thus far, the main sticking points are reportedly on the mentioned points of fishing, according to Bloomberg. Overall, officials from both sides have been upbeat on signing a deal of some form to improve relations, but it remains to be seen how far this will go, what concession(s) either side may have to give and, perhaps most importantly, if it has any implications for UK-US and/or EU-US talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese Activity Data (Mon):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China will release April activity data on Monday, including Industrial Production, Retail Sales, Fixed Asset Investment, and the national Unemployment Rate. The release will be the first full data set to capture the economic impact of April’s tariff escalation, though sentiment has since improved following the temporary 90-day tariff truce announced last week, potentially tempering the importance of the series. In terms of prior readings, Industrial Production Y/Y printed at 7.7% in March, Industrial Production YTD at 6.5%, Retail Sales Y/Y at 5.9%, Retail Sales YTD at 3.61%, Fixed Asset Investment YTD at 4.2%, Unemployment Rate at 5.2%, and House Prices Y/Y at -4.5%. For April, both Industrial Output and Retail Sales are seen moderating to 5.5%. Desks expect the data to reflect tariff-related disruptions, particularly in export-linked manufacturing and private-sector investment. However, the recent easing in trade tensions may limit downside pressure in upcoming prints. While the rollback of US tariffs on China to 30% (from 145%) offers temporary relief, analysts suggest structural challenges in consumption and property remain unresolved. Any weakness in retail or employment figures may strengthen the case for further easing measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBoC LPR (Tue):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBoC will announce China’s Loan Prime Rates next week which are expected to be reduced by 10bps with the 1-year LPR (the rate most new loans are based on) currently at 3.10% and the 5-year LPR (reference for mortgages) currently at 3.60%. Expectations for reductions are not much of a surprise given that PBoC Governor Pan had announced sweeping measures to ease policy earlier this month including a 50bps RRR cut and 10bps cut to the policy interest rate with the 7-day Reverse Repo lowered by 10bps to 1.40% and the Standing Lending Facility reduced by 10bps for all tenors. Pan also announced they will lower re-lending rates, interest rates on structural policy tools, and the personal housing provision fund rate all by 25bps, as well as guide commercial banks to lower deposit rates. Pan also stated that China will use multiple policy tools to make dynamic adjustments and is to set up CNY 500bln in re-lending loans for elderly care and service consumption, while the total quota of two monetary policy tools to support capital markets was optimised to CNY 800bln and there were additional CNY 300bln of funds each for tech financing and Rural/SME lending. As such, the RRR cut was estimated to have released CNY 1tln in long-term liquidity, while Pan also stated that the 10bps cut in the policy interest rate is expected to drive down the Loan Prime Rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA Announcement (Tue): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RBA is expected to cut rates at its policy meeting next week with money markets pricing in a 98% likelihood for the Cash Rate to be lowered by 25bps to 3.85% and just a 2% chance for rates to be maintained at the current level of 4.10%. As a reminder, the RBA decided to maintain the Cash Rate at the last meeting in April which was unanimously expected given that the central bank had just delivered a cut at the prior meeting in February and voiced cautiousness regarding future cuts. The language from the central bank provided very little clues regarding future policy adjustments as it noted that the outlook remains uncertain and underlying inflation is moderating, while sustainably returning inflation to target is the priority and the board’s assessment is that monetary policy remains restrictive. RBA also said that monetary policy is well-placed to respond to international developments if they were to have material implications for Australian activity and inflation. It also noted the continued decline in underlying inflation is welcome but there are risks on both sides with the board cautious about the outlook and it acknowledged inflation could move in either direction. Furthermore, the minutes from that meeting revealed the RBA thought it was not yet possible to determine the timing of the next move in rates nor was it appropriate at that stage for policy to react to potential risks. However, it stated that the May meeting would be an opportune time to reconsider with the decision not predetermined. Governor Bullock commented during the post-meeting press conference that the Board had not made up its mind on a May move, was not endorsing the market path on future rate cuts and did not open the door to a May rate cut. Nonetheless, the market is heavily anticipating a cut next week to support the economy and ease the burden on borrowers, with big 4 bank NAB even calling for a jumbo 50bps move, while recent data releases including contractions in household spending and building approvals, as well as inflation residing in the RBA’s 2-3% target, supports the case for the RBA to resume it rate reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada CPI (Tue):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April release will be published on Tuesday. The previous data for March showed the rate of headline CPI easing to 2.3% Y/Y (prev. 2.6%), driven by lower gasoline and travel prices; core CPI eased to 2.2% Y/Y (prev. 2.7%). The Bank of Canada&apos;s meeting minutes, released at the end of April, noted that the Governing Council agreed price pressures beyond April were hard to predict. Members favouring a rate cut highlighted the need for timely action, citing lags in policy transmission, anchored inflation expectations, muted near-term inflation risks, and economic weakness. Those favouring no change warned a further cut could be premature due to potential inflation pressure from tariffs. Money markets are currently pricing almost two 25bps rate reductions from the BoC by the end of the year, with the first fully discounted move seen by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CPI (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April’s release is expected to see a marked jump. Upside is expected to be driven by price hikes at various utility providers, tax increases and then the usual setting of index prices in April; inflationary effects from the tariff situation are factoring into this. The BoE expects this dynamic to continue in the months ahead and inflation to hit 3.7% by September, partially driven by the aforementioned factors. Thereafter, the BoE looks for inflation to fall back to target; in the meantime, the May forecasts look for inflation to be at an average of 3.4% in Q2 and 3.5% in Q3. For April, Pantheon expects the headline figure to increase to 3.6% Y/Y (prev. 2.6%), surpassing the latest BoE forecast of 3.4%. On the BoE’s peak forecast of 3.7% in September, Pantheon believes risks are skewed to the upside as upcoming cost pressures could spark follow-up price increases. Back to April, Pantheon expects Services to tick up to 5.1% Y/Y (prev. 4.7%). Metrics will be digested by an increasingly divergence MPC; however, we will receive both the May and June CPI series before the June 19th policy announcement, an announcement that is expected to see rates unchanged with the focus instead on August for the next potential cut, as it stands markets ascribe around a 55% chance of a 25bps cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECB Minutes (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April’s meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is “likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions”; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn’t add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock. From the Minutes, we are attentive to whether 50bps was discussed at all (Lagarde said there was no argument for it), whether there were any relatively firm views on a June cut expressed as sources have suggested, and if any opposition to the decision to remove language around restrictive was expressed. As usual, the Minutes will be regarded as stale and likely even more so than normal given recent significant tariff developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EZ Flash PMI (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone releases its Flash PMIs for May on Thursday, Manufacturing expected at 49.5 (prev. 49.0), Services at 50.3 (prev. 50.1) and Composite at 50.8 (prev. 50.4). The prior readings saw Manufacturing at 49.0, Services at 50.1, and the Composite at 50.4. While April’s data showed only mild improvement, recent survey indicators such as Sentix and ZEW have rebounded, suggesting the initial wave of pessimism following the US “Liberation Day” tariffs may have moderated. Oxford Economics notes the strong Q1 German industrial output was driven by front-loaded US demand in autos and pharma, raising the risk of a Q2 correction as that temporary boost unwinds. The temporary 90-day tariff truce between the US and China has also eased market anxiety around global trade spillovers, though uncertainty around US-EU trade relations remains elevated, with US Treasury Secretary Bessent recently suggesting progress was slow. From a policy perspective, the ECB is widely expected to cut rates in June, a weak PMI print would likely reinforce that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Flash PMI (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK will release Flash PMIs for May on Thursday, Manufacturing is seen at 45.9 (prev. 45.4) and Services at 49.5 (prev. 49.0). UK PMIs saw a sharp deterioration in April, with the Composite PMI at 48.2 (exp. 50.4, prev. 51.5), marking the first contraction in private sector output since October 2023. The Services PMI came in at 48.9 (exp. 51.5, prev. 52.5), while Manufacturing dipped to 44.0 (exp. 44.0, prev. 44.9), its lowest level in nearly three years. S&amp;amp;P Global cited falling domestic and external demand, with new orders declining for a fifth consecutive month and export business contracting at the fastest rate since May 2020. With the US-China 90-day tariff truce now in place, desks expect some relief on trade sentiment, but domestic cost pressures and demand fragility persist. A sub-50 composite print in May would reinforce the narrative of a stalling UK recovery and potentially support some expectations for a summer/late-summer BoE rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese CPI (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan will release national CPI data for April on Friday, the core Y/Y is expected to tick up to 3.4% (prev. 3.2%). The prior national figures showed Core CPI Y/Y at 3.2%, headline CPI Y/Y at 3.6%, and M/M CPI at 0.3%. Desks expect the April data to reflect residual effects from the reduction in energy subsidies and fresh fiscal year price hikes, particularly in food and education. Tokyo CPI — considered a leading indicator — accelerated to 3.4% Y/Y (vs. exp. 3.2%, prev. 2.4%), while the “core-core” index (ex-fresh food and fuel) jumped to 3.1% (prev. 2.2%), raising pressure on the BoJ. While policymakers kept rates steady at the May 1st meeting, recent commentary suggests a readiness to hike further if inflation remains sticky. However, global risks, especially from US tariffs and softening external demand, may limit the BoJ’s near-term scope. It was reported that Japan’s top trade negotiator Akazawa could travel to Washington next week for a third round of trade talks, according to Reuters sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Retail Sales (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hard data read on the sector under Trump’s tariffs, an April series which follows a strong Q1. For April, Investec expects further growth in sales volumes but at a more moderate pace than seen last time, forecasting 0.3% (prev. 0.4%) M/M; attributing much of this expected upside to good weather and the increase in the National Living Wage. In terms of other leads, the Barclaycard consumer spending report for the period saw the largest uplift in card spending since June 2023, driven by favourable weather and the Easter period. Elsewhere, NIQ/GfK Consumer Confidence fell in the month amid an increase in multiple utilities and concerns around renewed high inflation. Overall, the Retail series is expected to remain robust but with a slightly slower pace of sales volume growth as the favourable influence of good weather is offset by utility increases and price concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsquawk.com/daily/article/?id=4568-week-ahead-highlights-include-ukeu-summit-china-activity-data-pboc-lpr-rba-global-pmi-data-inflation-from-japan-canada-and-the-uk&amp;amp;utm_source=forexlive&amp;amp;utm_medium=research&amp;amp;utm_campaign=partner-post&amp;amp;utm_content=week-ahead&quot;&gt;Newsquawk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;A Penny Stock - API Isotopes (ASPI) Conversation: Balancing Risk, Reward, and Reality (And You Can Also Check out ASPI Stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing is often discussed in dry terms of charts, analysis, and percentages, but let&apos;s step away from that and eavesdrop on a candid and lively conversation between two seasoned investors, John and Mike. Friends since their early days, they&apos;ve seen markets rise and fall, experienced wins and losses, and continually explore new ways to balance risk and reward. This dialogue unfolds naturally, spotlighting the dynamics of penny stocks versus startups and mega caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Hey bro, how&apos;s the market treating you? Still dabbling in real estate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Same old, man. Real estate’s good but pricey entry points, as always. Anything new in startups or real estate on your end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Nah, I&apos;ve cooled off. Moved some cash into mega caps—Microsoft, NVIDIA. I got NVIDIA near $100, rode it up to $150, sold just 20%. Wish I&apos;d sold more. It went down to $85, now climbing again. Hanging tight, AI&apos;s the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Smart move. If you&apos;re betting big, mega caps are stable and predictable. Harder to get burned badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Exactly. But part of me misses that excitement. Investing $100k into a startup sounds thrilling, but can&apos;t afford that yet. Something like $5k turning into $100k in a couple years sounds just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: There’s a sweet spot there—between mega caps and high-risk startups. Ever considered penny stocks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Penny stocks? Aren&apos;t they just manipulated traps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Some can be, sure. But consider this—startups are riskier. Less liquidity, no easy exit. Remember, your early startup play paid off well, but that was lucky, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: True. Pure luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Well, penny stocks sit in a middle ground. Yes, they&apos;re risky, but you have liquidity and flexibility. If the price doubles, you can cash out partially and ride the rest risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Interesting perspective. How do you pick one that might actually succeed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Technicals help—relative strength, clear channels, volume trends. Take this stock, ASP Isotopes, for instance. If it moves back up to the top of its channel, your $10,000 could become $40,000. That would be a 300% profit vs a 15% risk. 20 times RR or risk reward, as they say, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Seriously? Sounds too good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Yeah, but remember—it’s all potential. Let&apos;s say you jump in at around $6.85. Set a stop at $5.84; that&apos;s a 15% risk. You could afford losing $1,500 on your $10k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Okay, and if that doesn&apos;t pan out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: You get a second shot lower down, near $5.25. Even better technical support. Now your potential upside jumps to around 30 times your investment. Risk another $1,500, total risk $3,000, but now the potential reward—if you lost $1,500 on the 1st go, and put in another $10k buy in the 2nd go, again risking 15%, so $1,500... and then your $10k buy of ASPI stock at at a $5.31 per share... well, your&apos;re holding about 1880 ASPI shares. If it goes up to that top channel area, and you sell at $27 per share, you get apx $48.5K. Minus the $3k you invested overall, you go home with just over $45,000. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Boom indeed. That&apos;s appealing. Two shots at glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Exactly. Plus, penny stocks offer flexibility startups can&apos;t match. But be careful—earnings surprises could hit hard overnight. That&apos;s why your risk management is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Makes sense. So no using money meant for mortgage or necessities, just play money I&apos;m comfortable losing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Precisely. You got it. The reward is tempting, but the risk is real. You understand that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Absolutely, man. I&apos;m not new to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engaging dialogue between John and Mike illustrates a fundamental truth of investing: understanding and balancing risk and reward is crucial. Penny stocks can serve as an intriguing middle ground—offering more liquidity and flexibility than startups, with potentially greater returns than mega caps, though at increased risk. Always remember, investing in high-risk ventures like penny stocks should involve money you can comfortably afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in more insights or spotting similar opportunities?

                            &lt;p&gt;The US government is in the middle of discussing a generational tax cut and Moody&apos;s just voted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings agency downgraded the full faith and credit of the USA to Aa1 from Aaa. That means that all three ratings agencies have now removed the US top rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop comes a year after Moody&apos;s lowered its outlook on the US. That was a sign this could be coming but the usual 18-24 month guideline was spend up so that it would be lobbed at a high stakes time. Moody&apos;s says the new rating is stable but also highlights the obvious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on 
measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and 
growing interest costs,&quot; Moody&apos;s said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlighted the upcoming budget bill to note that it doesn&apos;t see any meaningful multi-year reductions in mandatory spending under the current proposals. With that, they say the USA&apos;s fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to other highly-rated sovereigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we recognize the US’ significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics,” Moody’s wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of one of those metrics, they see US dept-to-GDP rising to about 134% of GDP in 2035 compared to 98% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some very late moves in the market on this and I&apos;d expect it&apos;s negative for the dollar on Monday and positive for gold.&lt;/p&gt;

An earlier report about Japan balking at US trade negotiations didn&apos;t get much traction and the market was middling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It eventually sprang to life after the UMich report, which once again showed a dismal reading on consumer confidence but it was likely the continued surge in inflation expectations that caught the market&apos;s attention. That reversed a drop in yields and pared some of the Fed cut pricing seen in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the US dollar found some decent bids and EUR/USD sank to 1.1131 from 1.1200. It was a broad move in the dollar that included a rise in USD/JPY to 146.05 from 145.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the day wore on, some US dollar sellers returned but the moves were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger conclusion from markets this week is that the trade war has likely peaked, and I&apos;m on board with that thinking. That doesn&apos;t mean it will be easy from here. It was a refreshingly quiet week in the latter half as Trump went to the Middle East and that helped to lift risk assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s probably too much to ask for more of the same next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
