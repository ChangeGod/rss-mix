      <title>AUDUSD stalls at 200-day MA after breakout fails above 0.64687</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;472&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD made a strong push higher this week, breaking above a key swing area between 0.6429 and 0.64419, and stretching to test the 200-day moving average near 0.64614. The bullish momentum even briefly took the price above 0.64687, but buyers could not sustain the move, and the breakout failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;474&quot; data-end=&quot;745&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is now backing off from those highs, putting pressure back on the former resistance-turned-support zone between 0.6429 and 0.64419. This area will be critical going forward. If buyers are to maintain short-term control, they must defend this zone on any dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;747&quot; data-end=&quot;1012&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break back below 0.6429 would weaken the bullish bias and shift focus toward support levels near 0.6407 (swing high from February) and 0.6390 (swing highs from March). On the topside, a sustained break above 0.6461 to 0.6468 would open the door toward the 0.6535 resistance level.&lt;/p&gt;

The record was a 14-day winning streak that ended on April 15, 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at this chart though, I&apos;m struck by how few of the nine-day streaks turned into 10-day streaks.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US stock indices are extending to new session highs after reports that China is looking to offer to the US a solution for fentanyl as a springboard toward more trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains are led by the NASDAQ index which is currently up 323 points or 1.83% at 18034.90. The S&amp;amp;P index is up 91.34 points or 1.63% at 5695.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the S&amp;amp;P index on the weekly chart, the price is approaching the 50 week moving average at 5698.59. The high price just reached 5696.60. The moving average will be a key barometer that would need to be broken to increase the bullish bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the daily chart, the 200-day moving average comes at 5746.05. Yesterday, the index moved above its 50-day moving average at 5582.90. That 50-day moving average is now a risk/bias-defining level. A break of the 50-week moving average would have traders looking toward the 200-day moving average as the next key upside target&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ is reporting that Beijing weighs Fentanyl offer to US to start the trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing and distribution of a drug whose purpose to kill is a good idea. I know the US and China have differences, but to knowingly flood through smuggling a drug that kills indiscriminately is just as evil as you can get.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;162&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD buyers had their opportunity earlier this week, briefly driving the price to the highest level since March 2022 (above 1.3433) — but they couldn’t sustain the breakout. The pair reversed lower after reaching 1.34413, just above the 2024 high of 1.3433, marking a failed upside attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;735&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since then, the pair has moved lower and broke below both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages (blue and green lines on the chart above) on Wednesday. The 100-hour MA capped Wednesday’s corrective rebound keeping the sellers in control in the short term. On Thursday and again today, the lower 200-hour MA (green line) has contained upside attempts, reinforcing resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, buyers showed resilience today as the price found support at yesterday’s low, forming a temporary floor. This repeat bounce raises the importance of this area as a key short-term support level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It would take a move below that level to open the door toward the low from last week and 1.3232. Below that a swing level at 1.3201 – 1.3206 would be targeted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the low price from yesterday and today cannot be broken, dip buyers would still need to get the price back above the 200 and 100-hour moving averages to get more upside confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are more in control with the corrective highs this week stalling below the hourly moving average levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Technical Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1182&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1185&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1185&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-hour MA (~1.33298)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1211&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1213&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;100-hour MA (~1.3352)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1237&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1239&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;2024 high: 1.3433&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1258&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1260&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1277&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Double bottom near 1.3259&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3232 (last week’s low)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.32017 to 1.3206.

                            &lt;p&gt;Axios is reporting that Stephen Miller is gaining momentum as a top contender to become President Trump’s next national security adviser (NSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;311&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;313&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Miller is currently the Homeland Security adviser and a key architect of Trump&apos;s immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;425&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;427&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The position opened after Mike Waltz was removed as NSA and nominated to be the next U.N. ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;537&quot; data-end=&quot;658&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;539&quot; data-end=&quot;658&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily handling NSA duties, but is said to be too busy to do both long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;659&quot; data-end=&quot;787&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;661&quot; data-end=&quot;787&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Miller has impressed internally, running the Homeland Security Council “like clockwork” with far fewer staff than the NSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;169&quot; data-end=&quot;487&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF is trading in a choppy fashion following the U.S. jobs report, moving above and below its converged 100- and 200-hour moving averages, both currently near 0.8254. The pair has traded between a session high of 0.8275 and a low of 0.8226, effectively bracketing those key technical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;774&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The convergence of the moving averages reflects the sideways price action seen over the past eight trading days. As shown in the red box on the chart, the pair has been confined to a narrow 138-pip range, with lows repeatedly forming near 0.8195 and highs capped at 0.8333.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;776&quot; data-end=&quot;1076&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This consolidation phase comes after a steep drop from the April high of 0.8855 to the April low of 0.8039. The current sideways pattern suggests that the market is undecided — weighing whether to resume the broader downtrend or attempt a more meaningful retracement of the April decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, a break outside the 0.8195–0.8333 range will be needed to clarify the next directional move.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a relatively quick turnaround by Canadian standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The solid non-farm payrolls print today and rebound in the stock market has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/june-fed-cut-odds-sink-after-the-jobs-report-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;pricing &lt;/a&gt;for a June cut down to 40% from as high as 75% last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is now piling on and pushing their cut fall to the July 30 meeting from June 18. With today&apos;s jobs report, the Fed won&apos;t get another one before the June meeting and that will make it tough to justify a cut, even if the June print is soft (it would just be one number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Goldman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 177k in April, above expectations. Payroll growth was revised down by 43k in March and 15k in February. The three-month average of payroll growth now stands at 155k. The unemployment rate was unchanged on a rounded basis at 4.2%. Our estimate of the underlying pace of job growth based on the payroll and household surveys now stands at 149k. We are pushing back the first fed funds rate cut in our forecast to the July FOMC meeting (vs. June previously), reflecting today&apos;s better-than-expected payrolls report and a better-than-feared April ISM reading yesterday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The comments from Trump after Carney&apos;s win sparked some optimism that US-Canada tensions would ebb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we&apos;re going to have a great relationship,&quot; he says. &quot;He was 
running for office. They both hated Trump -- and it was the one that 
hated Trump the least, I think, that won.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what would be the ultimate deal? If Trump pledges quick approvals on the Keystone XL pipeline. It would be a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The stock market is showing a vibrant landscape today, with the technology sector leading a healthy upward trend. However, not all is bullish, as major tech player Apple faces significant declines amidst otherwise positive growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📈 Technology Sector: A Beacon of Growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology sector stands out with remarkable gains. Microsoft (MSFT) is up 2.70%, accompanied by Oracle (ORCL) gaining 4.12% and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surging 5.51%. These movements are driven by positive earnings reports and upbeat forecasts in tech infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📉 Consumer Electronics: Apple&apos;s Decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) is experiencing a substantial drop of 2.98%, due to issues surrounding supply chain constraints and market saturation concerns. This downturn places pressure on the consumer electronics segment, making it a critical focal point for potential correction in upcoming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚀 Communication Services: Sustaining Momentum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the communication services sector, both Google (GOOG) and Meta Platforms (META) show robust growth, with gains of 1.90% and 3.93%, respectively. These stocks are buoyed by increased digital ad spending and expanding user bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏦 Financial Sector: Steady Climb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial sector displays steady optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) are both up by 2.20%, while Visa (V) sees a rise of 1.72%. Investors appear confident in financials as interest rates remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏥 Healthcare Surges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is another top performer today. Eli Lilly (LLY) climbs 2.94% after positive results from its latest clinical trials. This surge highlights the sector’s resilience and potential for continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💡 Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, today’s market reflects a positive sentiment with notable sector-specific dynamics. The robust performance in technology and healthcare counters the weakness in consumer electronics, specifically Apple. Today&apos;s resilience against external economic concerns suggests a cautiously optimistic view from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📊 Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may want to capitalize on the momentum in tech and healthcare sectors, potentially rebalancing portfolios to reduce exposure to underperforming segments like consumer electronics. Monitoring supply chain developments and upcoming earnings releases will be key for informed decision-making. As always, staying tuned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; will keep you updated on these dynamic market shifts. 📊&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;351&quot; data-end=&quot;625&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD moved higher in early U.S. trading on Friday, breaking decisively above both its 100-hour moving average at 1.1356 and 200-hour moving average at 1.1363. This move marks a clear bullish shift in short-term momentum after several days of consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;627&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier in the week, the pair found consistent support near the 1.1265–1.1270 area, with today’s low holding just above that zone at 1.12735.

Below that, traders will be eyeing the 1.1328–1.1307 swing area, which previously acted as a strong floor earlier this week and again on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1010&quot; data-end=&quot;1038&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Technical Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1039&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1039&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1041&quot; data-end=&quot;1056&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1087&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1061&quot; data-end=&quot;1087&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1403 (topside trendline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1090&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1092&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1424 (high for the week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1121&quot; data-end=&quot;1133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1138&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1351–1.1363 (100/200-hour MAs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1205&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1175&quot; data-end=&quot;1205&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1328 and 1.1307 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1208&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1210&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1265–1.1270 (major base zone)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a big week for the oil market with the main OPEC+ meeting set for Monday. There have been some conflicting reports about how eager OPEC is to bring back curtailed barrels and how far Saudi Arabia is willing to go to punish cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI is struggling today down 95-cents to $58.31. I&apos;m not sure this report tells us anything.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Despite a jobs report that means (according to WSJ Timiraos, that the &quot;Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&quot; and &quot;makes a June rate cut less likely&quot;, the USD is moving lower with the USDCAD extending to new lows for the year and the lowest level for the year and going back to October 2024.  Reports that Canada PM Carney is meeting Trump may be hopeful of a deal for Canada sooner rather than later (or maybe not?) and may be supportive for the CAD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;220&quot; data-end=&quot;515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the USDCAD tried to rebound earlier today but ran into stiff resistance near the 100-hour (1.3825) and 200-hour (1.3842) moving averages, which capped the upside. The high price reached 1.3837—just below the 200-hour MA—before sellers took control and pushed the pair back lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, support has reemerged near the April low and red-box consolidation floor at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the pair broke briefly below this level to a new cycle low of 1.3769, but momentum faded and buyers stepped in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both those targets have now been breached today with the pair reaching another  new low for the day and going back to October 2024 at 1.37638. Not all that convincing, but If the corrective rally can be limited, a new push could be made with more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, for those not jumping on the sell the USD, the failed break gives the dip buyers a new low to lean against. If the price moves below, get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, however, the sellers are more in control. The price highs today stalled at the MAs - Bearish. A new low was made - Bearish. The price is trading new lows going back to October - Bearish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So if buying, understand that you are swimming against that tide. Understand the risk. &lt;/p&gt;

 Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to 
you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess he didn&apos;t know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected this would be India and that can still come today but the US dollar weakness today may be partly on trade disappointment and the harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments &lt;/a&gt;that came from Japan today.&lt;/p&gt;

The value of the shares could change, of course, depending on Amazon’s stock price. If it declines, they would be worth less, if it rises, they would be worth more.

                            &lt;p&gt;The market has taken down the implied probability of a June rate cut from upwards of 75% last week down to 42% at present. The latest leg in the shift came after a solid but unspectacular non-farm payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Timiraos from the WSJ highlights the Fed&apos;s view:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The April jobs report makes a June rate cut less likely (even though that is a world away) because there will only be one more employment report before then.

For now, it means the Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year ahead, the market is now pricing in 111 bps in easing, about 20 basis points below what it was pricing last week. The combination of this data, GDP, ISM manufacturing, PCE data and corporate comments about consumer spending (especially Visa) has the market feeling good about the state of the economy -- or at least the state of the economy heading into the tariff war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all makes me wonder: Where would the market be right now without the tariffs? Inflation falling, the Fed cutting even as economy accelerated and Congress focused on the tax package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) STEADY HIRING IN APRIL WILL REINFORCE FED&apos;S &quot;PATIENT&quot; STANCE -- NICK TIMIRAOS

     Federal Reserve officials have broadly indicated that interest-rate cuts will likely require clear signs of rising unemployment.
     Because April&apos;s employment report offers very few indications of a broad-based decline in hiring, Fed officials can easily maintain their wait-and-see posture at their policy meeting next week-including by saying little that would offer any sign the central bank is prepared to lower interest rates at its subsequent meeting in mid-June.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STEADY HIRING IN APRIL WILL REINFORCE FED&apos;S &quot;PATIENT&quot; STANCE -- NICK TIMIRAOS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
     Federal Reserve officials have broadly indicated that interest-rate cuts will likely require clear signs of rising unemployment.&lt;br&gt;
     Because April&apos;s employment report offers very few indications of a broad-based decline in hiring, Fed officials can easily maintain their wait-and-see posture at their policy meeting next week-including by saying little that would offer any sign the central bank is prepared to lower interest rates at its subsequent meeting in mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD moved higher but is retracing some of the moves after the US jobs report which came in with the month revisions last month, about expectations.  This month rose 177K vs 130K (+47K), but the prior month was revised to 185K from 228K (-43K). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD: The EURUSD moved to a low of 1.1303 which briefly traded below lows from last week at 1.13072. However, the price is trading back higher and trades at 1.1330 currently. The high today stallled at the 100 hour moving average near 1.13516 currently .  Support 1.1307. Resistance 1.13516 now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY: The USDJPY moved up to 144.95, but is back down trading at 144.55 currently. There is a swing area between 144.45 and 144.55 that if broken would have traders looking toward the broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the March 27 high. That level comes in at 144.208.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD: The GBPUSD initially moved lower, but found buyers near the low from yesterday and the low for the week at 1.32594. The low price reached 1.3260. The next target on the top side comes in at 1.32922 followed by the high for the day near 1.3320 and the 200 hour moving average of 1.3330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDCAD: The USDCAD moved higher but found a willing seller&apos;s between the 200 hour moving average of 1.3842 and the 100 hour moving average of 1.32295. The high price reached and 1.32378 before rotating back to the downside. If the price is going higher it needs to get and stay above those moving averages. On the downside, the low of the red box consolidation area comes in at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the price moved below that level to a low of 1.3769 but could not sustain momentum and reestablished support against the prior low at 1.3781 before moving higher during yesterday&apos;s trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at US stocks in premarket trading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average up 438 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index up 64.61 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ up 214 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market yields are higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.770%, +6.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5  year yield 3.880%, +6.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.283%, +5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.779%, +4.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Happy Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures are upbeat on the comments from China about trade but I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments from Japan &lt;/a&gt;to be the story today, as the US appears &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-reluctant-to-exempt-japan-from-10-reciprocal-tariff-kyodo-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;to be set&lt;/a&gt; on leaving the majority of tariffs on permanently, including the 10% floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the market can turn away from tariffs for a few minutes and focus on the domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AnnaEconomist/status/1918040523249537501&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chart from Anna Wong&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the seasonal trend in leisure and hospitality hiring. Those are two industries that are likely to struggle in the months ahead, along with transport and construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that if today&apos;s report is strong, it will delay the inevitable pain from this later while if it&apos;s weak, then there was softness even ahead of this. I&apos;m not sure I agree but that&apos;s the sentiment that&apos;s out there.&lt;/p&gt;
