                            &lt;p&gt;WSJ&apos;s Nick Timiraos &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1922955125301108914&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;shared on X &lt;/a&gt;the current forecasts for the US PCE price index due in a couple of weeks. The PCE price index is the Fed&apos;s preferred inflation measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These forecasts can change a little after the US PPI today and the US Import prices tomorrow. It&apos;s certainly moving in the right direction, but unfortunately inflation is a lagging indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now pricing better growth ahead following the positive developments on the trade front. This is taking long term Treasury yields higher as inflationary pressures could return given that we might see a surge in economic activity as uncertainty eases.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Week 10 of EBC‚Äôs Million Dollar Trading Challenge II was
anything but ordinary. With wild market swings, leaderboard shake-ups, and a
community of traders keeping each other on their toes, this week had it all. If
you missed the action or just want the highlights, we‚Äôve got you covered with
answers to the week‚Äôs most burning questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made Week 10 so unpredictable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 10 was a rollercoaster! Gold kicked things off with a
sharp reversal, surprising many traders and shaking up the leaderboard.
Previous frontrunner @willsdad saw profits trimmed, while @forexwatchbrother
jumped on the opportunity with some well-timed long positions. It was a classic
case of ‚Äúexpect the unexpected‚Äù in the markets. Did forex pairs add to the
excitement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Midweek, major forex pairs like USD/JPY and
GBP/USD brought plenty of volatility. The smartest traders knew when to hold
back-like @songqiantongzi, who stayed on the sidelines during early whipsaws
and avoided unnecessary losses. Sometimes, patience really does pay off! Were
there any big comeback stories? You bet! Thursday delivered dramatic breakouts
in both gold and the S&amp;amp;P 500. @forexwatchbrother extended their lead with
bold trades, while @willsdad made a notable comeback by capitalising on equity swings.
In the Rising Stars group, @Gaoxin‚Äôs high-conviction trades pushed returns to
new highs and attracted a growing crowd of copiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the leaderboard look by the end of the week? It was
anyone‚Äôs game! @songqiantongzi regained ground with a string of profitable
trades, while @forexwatchbrother held onto a narrow lead. The Rising Stars
category stayed fiercely competitive, with several traders posting double-digit
returns and new contenders emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was happening on the community front?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC‚Äôs zero-fee copy trading platform was buzzing! More
traders than ever were following top performers, using real-time transparency
and signal ratings to learn and adapt. The community spirit was alive and well,
making Week 10 as much about shared learning as individual wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finale is Nearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 10 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;EBC‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;
Million Dollar Trading Challenge II was full of surprises, comebacks, and community
energy. With the finale just around the corner, traders and followers alike are
gearing up for an exciting finish. Stay tuned-the best may be yet to come!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just a pause before the all-time high or a bigger correction is in the cards for Bitcoin?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has been on a great ride since Trump&apos;s tariff pause announcement back on April 9. We&apos;ve seen the same with the US stock market given that the main macro drivers for both are growth expectations and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, growth expectations continue to improve but a new risk is emerging: repricing in interest rates expectations. We already saw a more hawkish repricing as the market went from expecting 120 bps of easing in 2025 to just 50 bps at the moment. That was based on improving growth expectations and easing in recessionary fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the market could start focusing back on inflation as the potential surge in demand and economic activity on an easing in uncertainty, could restrain the Fed from cutting rates more than once this year. This repricing might trigger a bigger pullback in Bitcoin and the stock market in the short-term, although the uptrend would remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the economic data is now back in focus, especially on the inflation side. Watch out also for hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that we have an upward trendline defining the bullish momentum. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the 93,000 price area.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Gold Futures Analysis Today: Key Events, Market Sentiment, and OrderFlow Intel Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2178&quot; data-end=&quot;2203&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;üö© TRADER-UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2205&quot; data-end=&quot;2616&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gold futures (GC) strongly confirmed the bullish double-bottom scenario at 10:40, reversing the temporary bearish concern seen at 10:22. Robust Delta SL, Delta Change, and improved cumulative delta at the recent bar clearly demonstrate renewed bullish dominance. Traders holding bullish positions can confidently remain bullish, closely monitoring future bars for continued positive delta reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2618&quot; data-end=&quot;2700&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;AI-Based Order Flow Prediction Score: +6 (Bullish Bias, Strong Confidence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold futures (GC) have shown mixed performance recently. Over the last week, gold futures declined by 6.42%, reflecting weakened short-term sentiment. The one-month performance also signals caution with a 2.15% decrease. However, the broader perspective remains positive with gains of 6.74% over three months, 22.81% over six months, and a robust year-to-date (YTD) gain of 19.52%. Over the past year, gold futures have impressively increased by 33.59%, underlining its continuing appeal as a safe-haven asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Critical Economic Events (May 15, 2025):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several significant events today will likely influence gold price movements, particularly due to their impact on safe-haven sentiment and investor confidence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Producer Price Index (PPI): 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Retail Sales: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Unemployment Claims: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Empire State Manufacturing Index: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Philly Fed Manufacturing Index: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Housing Starts &amp;amp; Building Permits: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Trade Price Indices: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Industrial Production &amp;amp; Capacity Utilization: 9:15 AM EDT (4:15 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Business Inventories: 10:00 AM EDT (5:00 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;U. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment: 10:00 AM EDT (5:00 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&apos;s Speech: 12:40 PM GMT (3:40 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These economic indicators are closely monitored by investors as they directly influence market perceptions of economic stability, inflationary pressures, and the potential direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Specifically, the speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be highly scrutinized for insights on interest rate trends, economic outlook, and inflation management, which are key drivers for gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current GC Price: 3161&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How OrderFlow Intel Enhances Your Trading Decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our AI-based methodology utilizes specialized Order Flow data, tracking actual buyer and seller behaviors in real-time. Unlike traditional price charts alone, Order Flow analysis monitors buying and selling pressure, providing deeper insights into market sentiment and helping identify potential turning points like reversals or breakouts earlier and more reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Does OrderFlow Data Matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OrderFlow data offers transparency into market activities at critical price levels. By analyzing the intensity and volume of buying versus selling, traders gain valuable clues about whether buyers or sellers are taking control. This helps in precisely identifying reversals, consolidations, or continuation scenarios, greatly improving decision-making accuracy and timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Analysis &amp;amp; Findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our OrderFlow Intel recently identified a clear bullish reversal in Gold Futures (GC), initially confirmed by buyer strength at a key support level around 09:54 (approximate bar timing). After experiencing a brief bearish resistance near the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), buyers stepped back strongly at around 10:40, reinforcing bullish momentum. This recent action implies buyers have regained control and are likely positioning for further upward movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Levels Traders Should Watch Closely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value Area Low (VAL): 3131.6 ‚Äì acts as key support; strong bullish signals here can indicate reliable entry points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point of Control (POC): 3150 ‚Äì the price level with the highest traded volume, critical for identifying areas of strong market interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): 3155.4 ‚Äì commonly used by institutions; a crucial level for intraday market sentiment and direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value Area High (VAH): 3163 ‚Äì serves as immediate resistance; breaking and holding above it suggests continued bullish strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actionable Gold Trader Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders using OrderFlow Intel should consider bullish positions if GC maintains above today&apos;s VWAP (3155.4) and confidently breaks above the Value Area High (3163), signaling bullish continuation. Stops should be strategically placed below key levels such as the Point of Control (3150) or Value Area Low (3131.6) to protect against unexpected bearish reversals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion for Gold Traders Now (and Today):
OrderFlow Intel&apos;s analysis strongly supports a current bullish scenario in Gold Futures, provided price maintains its momentum above identified key levels. Traders should leverage these insights and key market levels for timely and well-managed trade entries and risk control.&lt;/p&gt;

All of this of course is before we see any impact from tariffs. So, it&apos;s pretty much outdated data.&lt;/p&gt;

The breakdown shows it comes amid a jump in capital goods in particular. The rise there (+3.2%) was accompanied by increases in output for durable consumer goods (+3.1%) and also intermediate goods (+0.6%). That was slightly offset by a fall in energy output (-0.5%) on the month.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2025 global supply growth forecast seen at 1.6 mil bpd (up by 380k bpd)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;2025 global demand growth forecast seen at 650k bpd for remainder of 2025 (down from 990k bpd in Q1)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;2025 average oil demand growth forecast seen at 740k bpd (up by 20k bpd)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;2026 average oil demand growth forecast seen at 760k bpd (previously 690k bpd)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The agency sees a further slowdown in oil demand growth, largely due to ongoing economic headwinds and rising EV sales. Adding to that is a further increase in supply as OPEC+ steps up production further. Not quite the positive outlook for the oil market as such. But at least looking to next year, IEA sees some better prospects compared to the month before.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD got a boost across
the board on Monday as the US-China tariff relief was a much better than
expected news. The market started to look at the more hawkish scenario where we
get an average 10% global tariff rate and economic activity picks up on an
easing in growth fears and general uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led to a hawkish
repricing in interest rates expectations with the market now seeing 50 bps of
easing for the Fed by year-end compared to like 120 bps at the peak of the
fears in April. The short dollar trade was pretty overcrowded so the unwinding
in positioning gave the greenback even more strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we repriced the interest
rates expectations, the USD started to lose ground against the major currencies
once again. We will likely need the market to price in an even less dovish path
for interest rates to give the greenback another boost. That could come from
economic data or hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it‚Äôs been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent positive mood in
the markets weighed on the Japanese Yen which lost ground against all the major
currencies despite the market increasing the expectations for another rate hike
this year. We got a rally in the JPY yesterday although there was no clear
catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis ‚Äì Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY fell back below the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; in what could end up being a
fakeout. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk
to reward setup around the upward trendline to position for a rally into the
151.00 handle, while the sellers will look for a break lower to increase the
bearish bets into the 140.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis ‚Äì 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that the price is now filling the Monday gap which could act as support.
This is where we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the
gap to position for a rally into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand,
will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the upward trendline
next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis ‚Äì 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on this
timeframe. The sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to push
into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break higher to increase the
bullish bets into the 151.00 handle next. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures, the US
PPI and the US Retail Sales data. We will also hear from Fed Chair Powell, so
it‚Äôs worth to keep an eye on that in case he delivers some market moving
comments. Tomorrow, we conclude the week with the Japanese Q1 GDP report and
the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU, US have agreed to intensify contact on trade talks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, time&apos;s a wasting. The meeting will only come around in the next three weeks and by then, there will only be five more weeks before the reciprocal tariffs pause times out.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We expect that the negotiations will lead to a good result&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But would like to make it clear that we are prepared to act if talks do not succeed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So far, it&apos;s been very slow-going in terms of any progress between the EU and US. Well, to be fair the only countries that are making real progress are the US&apos; closer allies i.e. UK, Japan, India, South Korea. If you think about it, it is a slap in the face to everyone else that China also got the same 10% baseline treatment after all the retaliation by only deciding to sit down and talk. Meanwhile, everyone else had no choice but to get that shoved down their throat even by trying to reconcile instead of retaliating.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s a bit of a check back for US stocks after the surging gains all through the week, mainly for tech shares.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s a much stronger promise than what was initially reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/india-reportedly-offers-to-cut-tariffs-gap-by-two-thirds-to-seal-trade-deal-with-the-us-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It will be interesting to see what Trump is offering back in return though. Will India be able to buy an exemption? Or is there still going to be the 10% baseline?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With his visit to the Middle East, Trump is turning his attention to other geopolitical matters this week. For markets in general, all of this at least buys further reprieve on the trade front after the US and China settled on a 90-day de-escalation since the weekend. As for the topic itself, Iran continues to defend their stance and not give in though. However, they did at least outline clear terms for accepting a deal but it remains to be seen if Ali Khamenei will be on board if the US can deliver as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The comments are putting a drag on oil though, with WTI crude down over 3% on the day now to $60.62.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;We have a very busy day ahead on the data front. In the European session, there won&apos;t be that much as we just get the Eurozone Q1 GDP (2nd estimate) and the Eurozone Employment Change data. Both of them are old news and rarely market moving releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have lots of data but the main highlights include the US PPI, US Jobless Claims and US Retail Sales. The Core PPI Y/Y is expected at 3.1% vs. 3.3% prior, while the M/M reading is seen at 0.3% vs. -0.1% prior. I think the focus switched back to inflation so watch out for surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Initial Claims are expected at 229K vs. 228K prior, while Continuing Claims are seen at 1890K vs. 1879K prior. The US Jobless
Claims continue to be one of the most important releases to follow every week
as it‚Äôs a timelier indicator on the state of the labour market.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They haven&apos;t been market moving for several months because the data never surprised. Initial Claims remain below the cycle high at 260K. We will likely need a spike above that level to trigger a market reaction. Some analysts are suggesting we could see higher readings due to some seasonal patterns in the next weeks but as long as we stay below that 260K level, it should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Retail Sales M/M is expected at 0.0% vs. 1.5% prior, while the ex-Autos measure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.6% prior. The Control Group is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.4% prior. I don&apos;t really care about retail sales data myself because it&apos;s a volatile data set. Goldman Sachs expects core retail sales to rise in April as consumers frontloaded purchases ahead of impending tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;06:00 GMT - ECB&apos;s Cipollone (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;06:50 GMT - ECB&apos;s Elderson (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12:40 GMT/08:40 ET - Fed Chair Powell (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14:00 GMT/10:00 ET - BoE&apos;s Dhingra (uber dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18:05 GMT/14:05 ET - Fed&apos;s Barr (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Compared to the same month a year ago, the overall index is down 0.5% with the chunk of that owing to a decline in import prices (-1.8%).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The meeting on the sidelines here is said to involve US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and China&apos;s trade envoy, Li Chenggang. This as both parties were in attendance of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference. No further details are given on the engagement yet. But considering that it is just a pull aside conversation, there shouldn&apos;t be too much in it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FX option expiries for 15 May 10am New York cut</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are a couple to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The first one is for EUR/USD at the 1.1200 level. That might act as a bit of a magnet in trapping price action in between its key hourly moving averages in the session ahead at least. That especially after the upside run yesterday stalled at the 200-hour moving average. The key technical level is seen at 1.1249 currently with the 100-hour moving average seen at 1.1180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, there is one for AUD/USD at the 0.6475 level. It isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance with the pair struggling to get above 0.6500 in the bigger picture for the time being. So, the figure level takes on more importance in terms of limiting upside for the pair at this current point in time. The expiries should have negligible impact but could offer to hold upside during the session at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And lastly, there is one for NZD/USD at the 0.5880 level. That rests nearby the 200-day moving average of 0.5880 and might offer to keep price action stickier in the session ahead. The lows earlier in the week around 0.5850 will act as a secondary layer of short-term support. But trading sentiment will continue to be largely dictated by risk flows and dollar sentiment still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
