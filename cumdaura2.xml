Geopolitical
tensions in the Middle East flared after CNN reported that U.S.
intelligence believes Israel is preparing for a potential strike on
Iranian nuclear facilities. The report, based on unnamed
American officials familiar with recent intelligence, suggests that
Israel’s military planning is well underway — though any action
may hinge on the outcome of ongoing nuclear negotiations between
Washington and Tehran. While the report is heavily caveated, the
underlying message from U.S. sources is clear: a strike is a live
possibility. Energy markets reacted swiftly, sending
crude
prices surging
higher. They’ve since had some retracement. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;In
politics we had a unanimous 100–0 vote in the US Senate to pass the
No
Tax on Tips Act,
effectively making all tips tax-free. While the measure is being
framed as a win for service workers, some analysts warn of unintended
consequences. With tips now exempt from taxation, there’s concern
that efforts by workers and unions to push for higher base wages may
lose momentum, as employers shift more compensation into variable,
tip-based income. And since tips were already lightly taxed or often
underreported, the net impact could ironically result in lower
after-tax income for many low-wage workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Staying
in Washington, Politico reports a tentative agreement has been
reached to raise the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to
$40,000 as part of the broader GOP tax package. According to three
Republican lawmakers familiar with the closed-door talks, the deal
marks progress toward finalising the megabill, though some internal
objections remain and further negotiations are expected. While not
yet final, the proposed increase would represent a significant
concession aimed at winning broader support for the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We
had comments from three Fed officials. Cleveland
Fed President Beth Hammack, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly,
and
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. All three signalled caution,
Hammack summing it up by saying the
best course of action for the Federal Reserve right now is to &quot;sit
on our hands&quot; and closely monitor incoming data. Bostic
added that on issues like trade policy, clarity appears to be &quot;moving
further into the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;From
Japan we had trade data for April showing a surprise deficit.
Exports
to US fell
in April for first
time
in four
months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Also in Japan, 30-year and 40-year JGB yields have remained at or close to record highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;China’s
Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) strongly criticised recent US guidance
warning companies against using advanced Chinese semiconductors,
including Huawei’s Ascend AI chips. In a statement, a MOFCOM
spokesperson described the move as a “typical example of unilateral
bullying and protectionism,” accusing Washington of imposing
discriminatory restrictions on Chinese firms. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I’ve
noted the big mover, oil, above. But FX was not quiet. The upshot of
all the developments is a lower US dollar on the session here. All
major FX is higher against the friendless dollar. EUR/USD is up a
solid 50 points while USD/JPY and USD/CHF are down similar. GBP, AUD,
CAD, NZD all higher also. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Gold
has been lacklustre but is near its session high as I update.

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;172&quot; data-end=&quot;417&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Group of Seven (G7) nations are in discussions over coordinated tariff measures targeting low-value Chinese imports, as Western economies grow increasingly wary of what they describe as Beijing’s non-market practices and industrial overcapacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;419&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Canada’s Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne confirmed that talks are underway among G7 members to address the surge in inexpensive Chinese goods, which are often sold through e-commerce platforms at prices that evade traditional tariffs. Champagne  emphasised overcapacity issues and non-market behaviour that he says is distorting global trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;846&quot; data-end=&quot;1295&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The initiative follows recent moves by the United States to revoke the so-called de minimis exemption for certain Chinese e-commerce shipments. Under the previous rules, packages valued under $800 could enter the U.S. without incurring duties. The change, championed by Trump, targets popular platforms such as Temu and Shein, which have been accused of exploiting loopholes to flood Western markets with ultra-cheap goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1297&quot; data-end=&quot;1612&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;European governments are also considering similar measures. France, the UK, and the broader European Union have floated proposals to impose duties or administrative fees on low-value imports, with a focus on re-establishing fair competition for domestic producers and curbing the dominance of Chinese supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The talks signal a coordinated shift among developed economies to counterbalance China’s trade model, which officials argue is increasingly reliant on state-backed overproduction and aggressive pricing strategies across sectors ranging from solar panels to consumer electronics and textiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1907&quot; data-end=&quot;2114&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While concrete action has yet to be finalised, G7 officials suggest that tariffs on small packages could be one of several steps taken to address what they view as a systemic imbalance in global trade flows. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ICYMI - China gold imports surge to 11-month high</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/icymi-china-gold-imports-surge-to-11-month-high-20250521/</link>

      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/icymi-china-gold-imports-surge-to-11-month-high-20250521/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg had this on Tuesday, citing Chinese customs data. I saw April gold imports data earlier this month, but this is more detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China imported the most gold in nearly a year last month, as strong investor demand and central bank policy shifts pushed bullion inflows sharply higher despite record prices.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
According to customs data released Tuesday, gold imports jumped 73% month-on-month to 127.5 metric tons in April — the highest level since May 2024. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market participants attribute the spike in imports to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which is understood to have allocated fresh import quotas to select commercial banks in April. The central bank, which maintains tight control over physical bullion flows, typically issues licenses only to designated institutions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update (weekly candles):&lt;/p&gt;

The four approved agencies are: S&amp;amp;P, Moddy&apos;s, Fitch, and Japan&apos;s Rating &amp;amp; Investment Information (R&amp;amp;I). Only R&amp;amp;I has the US at AAA now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;497&quot; data-end=&quot;620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;499&quot; data-end=&quot;620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The HK Investment Funds Association has urged regulators to make an exception for US Treasuries rated just below AAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;621&quot; data-end=&quot;702&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;623&quot; data-end=&quot;702&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of end-2024, HK$484 billion in bond and mixed asset funds could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;703&quot; data-end=&quot;856&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;856&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The MPFA acknowledged the issue, confirming the US still qualifies under current rules, but said it will monitor developments and act if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;859&quot; data-end=&quot;980&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hong Kong funds are only one set of funds. If other jurisdictions should follow similar rules (they all do) then forced selling could occur. It won&apos;t be just the US bond markets that is ht. That&apos;s the worry and that&apos;s (one of the reasons, a biggie) why the downgrade matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;859&quot; data-end=&quot;980&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, retail equity buyers are like ....&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The airport has been beset by issues that haverve raised safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the US Federal Aviation Administration statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAA issued an interim order reducing the flight arrival and departure rate at Newark Liberty International Airport.Under the interim order issued Tuesday, the maximum hourly rate will be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;28 arrivals and 28 departures until construction of Runway 4-Left/22-Right is complete. Daily construction will end on June 15, 2025, but will continue on Saturdays until the end of the year. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outside of the construction period, 34 arrivals and departures until Oct. 25, 2025. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,” said Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau.The new limits take effect on May 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there folks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP TO APPOINT GEN. GUETLEIN TO LEAD $831B &apos;GOLDEN DOME&apos; MISSILE SHIELD

President Trump plans to name Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein to lead the &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; a new missile defense system aimed at protecting the U.S. from advanced threats like hypersonic weapons and low-flying missiles. The system would blend existing interceptors with satellite-based defenses.

The project could cost up to $831 billion over 20 years, with $25 billion proposed in the next budget. Guetlein, a space and missile defense expert, has warned of growing threats from China and backs increased U.S. space investments.

Trump is pushing for a fast rollout, prioritizing components that can be completed during his term. The &quot;Golden Dome&quot; will combine traditional and emerging defense technologies.</title>
