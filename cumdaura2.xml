      <title>(My Local Feed) $NVDA: SEAPORT GLOBAL SECURITIES INITIATES AT SELL - PT $100

&quot;Nvidia has been a major winner in the AI boom, but much of the optimism is already priced into the stock. Its next-gen Blackwell chips are sold out for the year due to packaging limits at TSMC. Deployment of Nvidia systems is complex, with cooling, configuration, and orchestration challenges. There are growing doubts about AIâ€™s immediate usefulness, as customers struggle to find real ROI. Hyperscalers, Nvidiaâ€™s biggest clients, are developing their own chips. AI spending may slow by 2026. While AI is likely not a bubble, its real value may take years to show. Nvidia could lag behind peers despite continued AI momentum.&quot;</title>
