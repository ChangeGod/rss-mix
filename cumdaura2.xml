                            &lt;p&gt;European Central Bank Board Member Schnabel spoke on Saturday, expressing a cautious approach to further rate cuts. Schnabel cited lingering uncertainties from global trade tensions and inflation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“We need to maintain a steady hand for now”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;warned that falling energy prices and slowing global growth may lower inflation in the short term but could reverse in the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We can leave rates broadly at the level they are at now and are confident that we can also maintain price stability in this way.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June&apos;s decision (the Bank meet on the 4th and 5th, markets are expecting a rate cut) Schnabel refrained from confirming her outright support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“It’s to be seen what will happen” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnabel remarked also on the euro’s recent appreciation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We now have a historic opportunity to further strengthen the international role of the euro”. To support that goal she reiterated the need for a unified European bond market and revisiting the idea of joint debt issuance. “I do think that it’s not fundamentally wrong to also think about joint debt to finance public goods in Europe”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnabel made similar &apos;steady hand&apos; comments earlier last week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ecb-should-keep-steady-hand-hold-rates-close-current-levels-schnabel-says-2025-05-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ECB should keep steady hand, hold rates close to current levels, Schnabel says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Latvian central bank governor, and therefore a Governing Council member of the European Central Bank, Martins Kazaks spoke on Friday with CNBC, ICYMI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, he said on Friday that interest rates may be close to their terminal level, though uncertainty remains high and further changes to the policy outlook are possible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“We are, by and large, within the baseline scenario” (the ECB inflation target is 2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“And if the baseline scenario holds, then I think we are relatively close to the terminal rate already”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;a couple of more cuts may be possible&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazaks said the outlook will depend on incoming data on developments in the economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is to see where the trade talk and the trade story take us, and then of course we&apos;ll act” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazaks expressed a similar view around three weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/ecbs-kazaks-urges-caution-on-further-european-centralbank-rate-cuts-20250427/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ECB&apos;s Kazaks urges caution on further European Central Bank rate cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank monetary policy Governing Council meets next on June 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mon: Canadian Holiday (Victoria Day), EU-UK Summit; Chinese Industrial Output (Apr), Retail Sales (Apr), House Prices (Apr), EZ HICP Final (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tue: PBoC LPR, RBA Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Financial Stability Report; EZ Current Account (Mar), Consumer Confidence Flash (May), Canadian CPI (Apr), German PPI (Apr), New Zealand Trade (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wed: Japanese Trade Balance (Apr),UK CPI (Apr), US MBA (w/e 12th May)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thu: ECB Minutes (Apr), CBRT Inflation Report; Australian Flash PMIs (May), Japanese Flash PMIs (May), UK PNSB (Apr), EZ, UK &amp;amp; US Flash PMIs (May), US Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 17th May), Canadian PPI (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fri: EZ Negotiated Wage Rates (Q1), Japanese CPI (Apr), German Detailed GDP (Q1), UK Retail Sales (Apr), US New Home Sales (Apr), Canadian Retail Sales (Mar)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-UK Summit (Mon):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives are meeting in London for a Brexit reset summit. Ahead of the gathering, the European Council has outlined the bloc’s priorities as defence/security. As usual for such meetings, fishing and youth mobility will draw significant headline attention and often serve as a barometer for the tone of talks, as they are typically the issues with the greatest divergence of views. The EU is sending Commission President von der Leyen, Council President Costa and diplomat Kallas to the summit. From the UK, PM Starmer will be the main representative. Thus far, the main sticking points are reportedly on the mentioned points of fishing, according to Bloomberg. Overall, officials from both sides have been upbeat on signing a deal of some form to improve relations, but it remains to be seen how far this will go, what concession(s) either side may have to give and, perhaps most importantly, if it has any implications for UK-US and/or EU-US talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese Activity Data (Mon):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China will release April activity data on Monday, including Industrial Production, Retail Sales, Fixed Asset Investment, and the national Unemployment Rate. The release will be the first full data set to capture the economic impact of April’s tariff escalation, though sentiment has since improved following the temporary 90-day tariff truce announced last week, potentially tempering the importance of the series. In terms of prior readings, Industrial Production Y/Y printed at 7.7% in March, Industrial Production YTD at 6.5%, Retail Sales Y/Y at 5.9%, Retail Sales YTD at 3.61%, Fixed Asset Investment YTD at 4.2%, Unemployment Rate at 5.2%, and House Prices Y/Y at -4.5%. For April, both Industrial Output and Retail Sales are seen moderating to 5.5%. Desks expect the data to reflect tariff-related disruptions, particularly in export-linked manufacturing and private-sector investment. However, the recent easing in trade tensions may limit downside pressure in upcoming prints. While the rollback of US tariffs on China to 30% (from 145%) offers temporary relief, analysts suggest structural challenges in consumption and property remain unresolved. Any weakness in retail or employment figures may strengthen the case for further easing measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBoC LPR (Tue):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBoC will announce China’s Loan Prime Rates next week which are expected to be reduced by 10bps with the 1-year LPR (the rate most new loans are based on) currently at 3.10% and the 5-year LPR (reference for mortgages) currently at 3.60%. Expectations for reductions are not much of a surprise given that PBoC Governor Pan had announced sweeping measures to ease policy earlier this month including a 50bps RRR cut and 10bps cut to the policy interest rate with the 7-day Reverse Repo lowered by 10bps to 1.40% and the Standing Lending Facility reduced by 10bps for all tenors. Pan also announced they will lower re-lending rates, interest rates on structural policy tools, and the personal housing provision fund rate all by 25bps, as well as guide commercial banks to lower deposit rates. Pan also stated that China will use multiple policy tools to make dynamic adjustments and is to set up CNY 500bln in re-lending loans for elderly care and service consumption, while the total quota of two monetary policy tools to support capital markets was optimised to CNY 800bln and there were additional CNY 300bln of funds each for tech financing and Rural/SME lending. As such, the RRR cut was estimated to have released CNY 1tln in long-term liquidity, while Pan also stated that the 10bps cut in the policy interest rate is expected to drive down the Loan Prime Rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA Announcement (Tue): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RBA is expected to cut rates at its policy meeting next week with money markets pricing in a 98% likelihood for the Cash Rate to be lowered by 25bps to 3.85% and just a 2% chance for rates to be maintained at the current level of 4.10%. As a reminder, the RBA decided to maintain the Cash Rate at the last meeting in April which was unanimously expected given that the central bank had just delivered a cut at the prior meeting in February and voiced cautiousness regarding future cuts. The language from the central bank provided very little clues regarding future policy adjustments as it noted that the outlook remains uncertain and underlying inflation is moderating, while sustainably returning inflation to target is the priority and the board’s assessment is that monetary policy remains restrictive. RBA also said that monetary policy is well-placed to respond to international developments if they were to have material implications for Australian activity and inflation. It also noted the continued decline in underlying inflation is welcome but there are risks on both sides with the board cautious about the outlook and it acknowledged inflation could move in either direction. Furthermore, the minutes from that meeting revealed the RBA thought it was not yet possible to determine the timing of the next move in rates nor was it appropriate at that stage for policy to react to potential risks. However, it stated that the May meeting would be an opportune time to reconsider with the decision not predetermined. Governor Bullock commented during the post-meeting press conference that the Board had not made up its mind on a May move, was not endorsing the market path on future rate cuts and did not open the door to a May rate cut. Nonetheless, the market is heavily anticipating a cut next week to support the economy and ease the burden on borrowers, with big 4 bank NAB even calling for a jumbo 50bps move, while recent data releases including contractions in household spending and building approvals, as well as inflation residing in the RBA’s 2-3% target, supports the case for the RBA to resume it rate reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada CPI (Tue):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April release will be published on Tuesday. The previous data for March showed the rate of headline CPI easing to 2.3% Y/Y (prev. 2.6%), driven by lower gasoline and travel prices; core CPI eased to 2.2% Y/Y (prev. 2.7%). The Bank of Canada&apos;s meeting minutes, released at the end of April, noted that the Governing Council agreed price pressures beyond April were hard to predict. Members favouring a rate cut highlighted the need for timely action, citing lags in policy transmission, anchored inflation expectations, muted near-term inflation risks, and economic weakness. Those favouring no change warned a further cut could be premature due to potential inflation pressure from tariffs. Money markets are currently pricing almost two 25bps rate reductions from the BoC by the end of the year, with the first fully discounted move seen by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CPI (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April’s release is expected to see a marked jump. Upside is expected to be driven by price hikes at various utility providers, tax increases and then the usual setting of index prices in April; inflationary effects from the tariff situation are factoring into this. The BoE expects this dynamic to continue in the months ahead and inflation to hit 3.7% by September, partially driven by the aforementioned factors. Thereafter, the BoE looks for inflation to fall back to target; in the meantime, the May forecasts look for inflation to be at an average of 3.4% in Q2 and 3.5% in Q3. For April, Pantheon expects the headline figure to increase to 3.6% Y/Y (prev. 2.6%), surpassing the latest BoE forecast of 3.4%. On the BoE’s peak forecast of 3.7% in September, Pantheon believes risks are skewed to the upside as upcoming cost pressures could spark follow-up price increases. Back to April, Pantheon expects Services to tick up to 5.1% Y/Y (prev. 4.7%). Metrics will be digested by an increasingly divergence MPC; however, we will receive both the May and June CPI series before the June 19th policy announcement, an announcement that is expected to see rates unchanged with the focus instead on August for the next potential cut, as it stands markets ascribe around a 55% chance of a 25bps cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECB Minutes (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April’s meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is “likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions”; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn’t add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock. From the Minutes, we are attentive to whether 50bps was discussed at all (Lagarde said there was no argument for it), whether there were any relatively firm views on a June cut expressed as sources have suggested, and if any opposition to the decision to remove language around restrictive was expressed. As usual, the Minutes will be regarded as stale and likely even more so than normal given recent significant tariff developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EZ Flash PMI (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone releases its Flash PMIs for May on Thursday, Manufacturing expected at 49.5 (prev. 49.0), Services at 50.3 (prev. 50.1) and Composite at 50.8 (prev. 50.4). The prior readings saw Manufacturing at 49.0, Services at 50.1, and the Composite at 50.4. While April’s data showed only mild improvement, recent survey indicators such as Sentix and ZEW have rebounded, suggesting the initial wave of pessimism following the US “Liberation Day” tariffs may have moderated. Oxford Economics notes the strong Q1 German industrial output was driven by front-loaded US demand in autos and pharma, raising the risk of a Q2 correction as that temporary boost unwinds. The temporary 90-day tariff truce between the US and China has also eased market anxiety around global trade spillovers, though uncertainty around US-EU trade relations remains elevated, with US Treasury Secretary Bessent recently suggesting progress was slow. From a policy perspective, the ECB is widely expected to cut rates in June, a weak PMI print would likely reinforce that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Flash PMI (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK will release Flash PMIs for May on Thursday, Manufacturing is seen at 45.9 (prev. 45.4) and Services at 49.5 (prev. 49.0). UK PMIs saw a sharp deterioration in April, with the Composite PMI at 48.2 (exp. 50.4, prev. 51.5), marking the first contraction in private sector output since October 2023. The Services PMI came in at 48.9 (exp. 51.5, prev. 52.5), while Manufacturing dipped to 44.0 (exp. 44.0, prev. 44.9), its lowest level in nearly three years. S&amp;amp;P Global cited falling domestic and external demand, with new orders declining for a fifth consecutive month and export business contracting at the fastest rate since May 2020. With the US-China 90-day tariff truce now in place, desks expect some relief on trade sentiment, but domestic cost pressures and demand fragility persist. A sub-50 composite print in May would reinforce the narrative of a stalling UK recovery and potentially support some expectations for a summer/late-summer BoE rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese CPI (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan will release national CPI data for April on Friday, the core Y/Y is expected to tick up to 3.4% (prev. 3.2%). The prior national figures showed Core CPI Y/Y at 3.2%, headline CPI Y/Y at 3.6%, and M/M CPI at 0.3%. Desks expect the April data to reflect residual effects from the reduction in energy subsidies and fresh fiscal year price hikes, particularly in food and education. Tokyo CPI — considered a leading indicator — accelerated to 3.4% Y/Y (vs. exp. 3.2%, prev. 2.4%), while the “core-core” index (ex-fresh food and fuel) jumped to 3.1% (prev. 2.2%), raising pressure on the BoJ. While policymakers kept rates steady at the May 1st meeting, recent commentary suggests a readiness to hike further if inflation remains sticky. However, global risks, especially from US tariffs and softening external demand, may limit the BoJ’s near-term scope. It was reported that Japan’s top trade negotiator Akazawa could travel to Washington next week for a third round of trade talks, according to Reuters sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Retail Sales (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hard data read on the sector under Trump’s tariffs, an April series which follows a strong Q1. For April, Investec expects further growth in sales volumes but at a more moderate pace than seen last time, forecasting 0.3% (prev. 0.4%) M/M; attributing much of this expected upside to good weather and the increase in the National Living Wage. In terms of other leads, the Barclaycard consumer spending report for the period saw the largest uplift in card spending since June 2023, driven by favourable weather and the Easter period. Elsewhere, NIQ/GfK Consumer Confidence fell in the month amid an increase in multiple utilities and concerns around renewed high inflation. Overall, the Retail series is expected to remain robust but with a slightly slower pace of sales volume growth as the favourable influence of good weather is offset by utility increases and price concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsquawk.com/daily/article/?id=4568-week-ahead-highlights-include-ukeu-summit-china-activity-data-pboc-lpr-rba-global-pmi-data-inflation-from-japan-canada-and-the-uk&amp;amp;utm_source=forexlive&amp;amp;utm_medium=research&amp;amp;utm_campaign=partner-post&amp;amp;utm_content=week-ahead&quot;&gt;Newsquawk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A Penny Stock - API Isotopes (ASPI) Conversation: Balancing Risk, Reward, and Reality (And You Can Also Check out ASPI Stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing is often discussed in dry terms of charts, analysis, and percentages, but let&apos;s step away from that and eavesdrop on a candid and lively conversation between two seasoned investors, John and Mike. Friends since their early days, they&apos;ve seen markets rise and fall, experienced wins and losses, and continually explore new ways to balance risk and reward. This dialogue unfolds naturally, spotlighting the dynamics of penny stocks versus startups and mega caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Hey bro, how&apos;s the market treating you? Still dabbling in real estate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Same old, man. Real estate’s good but pricey entry points, as always. Anything new in startups or real estate on your end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Nah, I&apos;ve cooled off. Moved some cash into mega caps—Microsoft, NVIDIA. I got NVIDIA near $100, rode it up to $150, sold just 20%. Wish I&apos;d sold more. It went down to $85, now climbing again. Hanging tight, AI&apos;s the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Smart move. If you&apos;re betting big, mega caps are stable and predictable. Harder to get burned badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Exactly. But part of me misses that excitement. Investing $100k into a startup sounds thrilling, but can&apos;t afford that yet. Something like $5k turning into $100k in a couple years sounds just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: There’s a sweet spot there—between mega caps and high-risk startups. Ever considered penny stocks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Penny stocks? Aren&apos;t they just manipulated traps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Some can be, sure. But consider this—startups are riskier. Less liquidity, no easy exit. Remember, your early startup play paid off well, but that was lucky, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: True. Pure luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Well, penny stocks sit in a middle ground. Yes, they&apos;re risky, but you have liquidity and flexibility. If the price doubles, you can cash out partially and ride the rest risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Interesting perspective. How do you pick one that might actually succeed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Technicals help—relative strength, clear channels, volume trends. Take this stock, ASP Isotopes, for instance. If it moves back up to the top of its channel, your $10,000 could become $40,000. That would be a 300% profit vs a 15% risk. 20 times RR or risk reward, as they say, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Seriously? Sounds too good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Yeah, but remember—it’s all potential. Let&apos;s say you jump in at around $6.85. Set a stop at $5.84; that&apos;s a 15% risk. You could afford losing $1,500 on your $10k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Okay, and if that doesn&apos;t pan out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: You get a second shot lower down, near $5.25. Even better technical support. Now your potential upside jumps to around 30 times your investment. Risk another $1,500, total risk $3,000, but now the potential reward—if you lost $1,500 on the 1st go, and put in another $10k buy in the 2nd go, again risking 15%, so $1,500... and then your $10k buy of ASPI stock at at a $5.31 per share... well, your&apos;re holding about 1880 ASPI shares. If it goes up to that top channel area, and you sell at $27 per share, you get apx $48.5K. Minus the $3k you invested overall, you go home with just over $45,000. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Boom indeed. That&apos;s appealing. Two shots at glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Exactly. Plus, penny stocks offer flexibility startups can&apos;t match. But be careful—earnings surprises could hit hard overnight. That&apos;s why your risk management is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Makes sense. So no using money meant for mortgage or necessities, just play money I&apos;m comfortable losing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John: Precisely. You got it. The reward is tempting, but the risk is real. You understand that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike: Absolutely, man. I&apos;m not new to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engaging dialogue between John and Mike illustrates a fundamental truth of investing: understanding and balancing risk and reward is crucial. Penny stocks can serve as an intriguing middle ground—offering more liquidity and flexibility than startups, with potentially greater returns than mega caps, though at increased risk. Always remember, investing in high-risk ventures like penny stocks should involve money you can comfortably afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in more insights or spotting similar opportunities?

                            &lt;p&gt;The US government is in the middle of discussing a generational tax cut and Moody&apos;s just voted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings agency downgraded the full faith and credit of the USA to Aa1 from Aaa. That means that all three ratings agencies have now removed the US top rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop comes a year after Moody&apos;s lowered its outlook on the US. That was a sign this could be coming but the usual 18-24 month guideline was spend up so that it would be lobbed at a high stakes time. Moody&apos;s says the new rating is stable but also highlights the obvious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on 
measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and 
growing interest costs,&quot; Moody&apos;s said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlighted the upcoming budget bill to note that it doesn&apos;t see any meaningful multi-year reductions in mandatory spending under the current proposals. With that, they say the USA&apos;s fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to other highly-rated sovereigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we recognize the US’ significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics,” Moody’s wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of one of those metrics, they see US dept-to-GDP rising to about 134% of GDP in 2035 compared to 98% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some very late moves in the market on this and I&apos;d expect it&apos;s negative for the dollar on Monday and positive for gold.&lt;/p&gt;

An earlier report about Japan balking at US trade negotiations didn&apos;t get much traction and the market was middling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It eventually sprang to life after the UMich report, which once again showed a dismal reading on consumer confidence but it was likely the continued surge in inflation expectations that caught the market&apos;s attention. That reversed a drop in yields and pared some of the Fed cut pricing seen in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the US dollar found some decent bids and EUR/USD sank to 1.1131 from 1.1200. It was a broad move in the dollar that included a rise in USD/JPY to 146.05 from 145.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the day wore on, some US dollar sellers returned but the moves were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger conclusion from markets this week is that the trade war has likely peaked, and I&apos;m on board with that thinking. That doesn&apos;t mean it will be easy from here. It was a refreshingly quiet week in the latter half as Trump went to the Middle East and that helped to lift risk assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s probably too much to ask for more of the same next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The big week for stock markets on the US-China climb-down is continuing late on Friday. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has edged to a fresh session high up 33 points, or 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading has been lighter late in the week but the momentum trade has continued to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, there isn&apos;t much (anything?) standing in the way of a return to the February highs. The AI trade is working again as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) US AND EU BREAK IMPASSE TO ENABLE TARIFF TALKS: FT

The US and EU have restarted trade talks to avoid Trump’s tariffs. Both sides exchanged proposals on tariffs, digital trade, and investment. EU officials warn some US tariffs on steel and cars will stay as the US reshoring push continues.

The EU has lagged behind other countries in striking deals. US negotiators demanded EU proposals or threatened full tariffs. Talks will focus on agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and trade imbalances.

The EU rejects US demands to weaken VAT and digital rules but may target Chinese goods to reduce dependence. EU ministers oppose a UK-style deal with lingering tariffs. Retaliatory measures remain on the table.</title>

      <title>(My Local Feed) US AND EU BREAK IMPASSE TO ENABLE TARIFF TALKS

The US and EU have begun serious trade talks to head off the worst of Donald Trump’s tariffs, breaking a deadlock that left the bloc near the back of a queue to negotiate with Donald Trump’s team.

The two sides have in recent days exchanged negotiating documents for the first time, outlining areas of discussion ranging from tariffs to digital trade and investment opportunities, according to four people familiar with the matter and an EU briefing note seen by the FT.</title>

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP FLOATS PLAN TO IMPOSE NEW TARIFF RATES

After progress with the U.K. and China, President Trump said the U.S. will stop negotiating individual trade deals and will soon notify countries of new tariffs for doing business in the U.S.

Despite this, markets held steady, with stocks slightly up Friday afternoon. However, consumer sentiment remains near record lows, with inflation fears above 7%, according to a University of Michigan survey. Housing data also disappointed, with starts up just 1.6% and permits down 4.7%.

Still, investors remain optimistic, citing strong earnings and easing U.S.-China tensions. Goldman Sachs&apos; Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo noted that with tariffs sidelined for now, focus may shift to budget and tax issues.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a light week on the economic calendar with the S&amp;amp;P PMIs as the only real market movers. I expect more &apos;wait-and-see&apos; from the Fed speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from what&apos;s listed here, we will be waiting for the US to strike some trade deals and House Republicans are aiming to pass Trump&apos;s budget.

                            &lt;p&gt;The opportunity to buy 30-year Treasuries yielding 5% briefly presented itself this week for the fourth time this year. All the other attempts were quickly beaten back and that same knee-jerk unfolded this time, driving yields to as low as 4.86% today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UMich report though seemed to underline ongoing angst about inflation and led to a bounce to 4.90%. If it holds, that will be the second-highest weekly close since October 2023 (the Liz Truss fiasco). Beyond that you need to go to before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the opportunity to buy bonds at these kinds of rates is rare and the market hasn&apos;t forgotten that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was probably some good news on the fiscal front for bonds today as some Republicans pushed back on the huge deficit increase that&apos;s coming in Trump&apos;s budget. That said, he&apos;s right to be highlighting that they&apos;re just grandstanding and will ultimately support it.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Total rigs down 2 to 576. It&apos;s the third consecutive weekly drop in rigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil market is in flux at the moment as OPEC brings back more barrels than anticipated and Trump zig-zags on trade policy. Natural gas is looking healthier though with days of US supply down about 18% y/y.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Someone the Federal Reserve system employs 26,000 people. That seems like an awful lot of people to manager currency, process checks and supervise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they&apos;ll be fine with a 10% haircut.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The vote failed in the Budget Committee, 16-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong belief in markets that they will twist the right arms in order to get it through when it matters. As it stands, this is putting the US on the path to another 1 or 1.5 percentage point increase in the deficit, or above 7% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The votes against it want to cut Medicaid, which looks like the battle ground at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like there won&apos;t be another vote today.&lt;/p&gt;

I think this masks the extent of the battle that will unfold between the EU and US on trade, as I don&apos;t see any easy path to a compromise there.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market presents a mixed bag of performances across various sectors. Let&apos;s delve into each area to understand the driving forces behind the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📈 Communication Services: Google (GOOG) surged by 1.98%, highlighting a strong performance in this sector. However, Meta (META) faced a decline of 1.69%, indicating divergent investor sentiments within digital platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📉 Semiconductors: The sector showed mixed signals with Nvidia (NVDA) inching up by 0.18% while Broadcom (AVGO) dropped by 1.99%. Concerns remain prevalent about overvaluations and potential supply chain disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🚀 Healthcare: A bright spot today, with Eli Lilly (LLY) leading the pack, gaining 2.40%. Robust drug pipeline news and strong earnings continue to fuel this sector&apos;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏦 Financials: A somewhat neutral day with Visa (V) increasing by 0.32% contrasted against JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slipping by 0.40%. Economic data and interest rate expectations are key factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏗️ Industrials and Energy: Both sectors faced challenges, with Exxon (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) down by nearly 1%. This reflects broader concerns over energy demand fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market sentiment today seems cautiously optimistic, with investors balancing growth opportunities against potential risks. Lingering inflationary pressures and evolving global economic indicators add complexity to investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech stocks reveal volatility, illustrating a rotation in investor focus towards more stable and defensive areas like utilities and healthcare. Meanwhile, communication services display resilience, as shown by Google&apos;s robust performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider Diversification: With today&apos;s volatility, diversifying portfolios could be beneficial. Focus on balanced exposure across defensive sectors such as healthcare and emerging market technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch Market Indicators: Keep a close eye on economic data releases that might impact interest rates and sector movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore Growth Opportunities: Strong performers in the healthcare sector, particularly biotech, could offer attractive entry points for growth-oriented investors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these uncertain times, staying informed with real-time market updates and analysis is crucial. Whether you&apos;re a seasoned investor or a market novice, continued vigilance and strategic adjustments will be key to navigating today&apos;s dynamic market landscape.

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar is bid across the board at the moment as yields rebound from earlier lows. US 2-year yields were at 3.92% earlier today but have ticked up to 3.96%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has grown more-hesitant about pricing in rate cuts after the UMich consumer sentiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/umich-may-prelim-consumer-sentiment-508-vs-534-expected-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;showed a surge in inflation expectations. One-year inflation rose to 7.3% from 6.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s notable that this was mostly before Trump backtracked on China tariffs so these numbers will assuredly come down in the final report or next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could also be seeing some flows ahead of the 4 pm London fix, so keep an eye out for a USD reversal after that.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 52.2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current conditions 57.6    vs 59.6 expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expectations 46.5   vs 48.0 expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-year inflation 7.3% vs 6.5% prior &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year inflation 4.6% vs 4.4% prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a poor reading. I would have expected to see some recovery after Trump reversed the Liberation Day tariffs but that didn&apos;t show up in this round. The pause in China tariffs should be a tailwind in the month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This was out earlier but it&apos;s an important development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/45d52534-00a1-42d5-be46-486cf34fcfb8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that Japan is holding out for a better deal with the US, including a full removal of 25% auto tariffs. It says a deal is now unlikely to be reached before elections due in late July, which is beyond the 90-day delay the US imposed (expiration is July 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been reports this week that Japanese and South Korean deals would be soon announced, though there is a meeting still planned for next week and the G7 in Canada will be closely watched.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each side will set out its vision for a future ceasefire, in detail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Russia asked for Ukraine unconquered territory so the question is whether Ukraine wants to keep talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is from Axios:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Russian delegation demanded the complete withdrawal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 4 regions, and when the Ukrainians refused, ours stood up and declared that next time they would have to leave 5 (including Dnipropetrovsk)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&apos;t sound promising.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are up 0.2% today as today is the monthly equity and single-stock options expiration. Those who bought on April 7 are certainly feeling good about those calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields are coming down and that&apos;s taking away one risk from stock markets in what&apos;s been an incredible run. Trump&apos;s trip to the Middle East has also made it pleasantly quiet on the domestic front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gain today would be the 5th in a row and that comes on the heels of a nine-day rally that was only broken up by a small loss on May 9. There has only been one negative day since April 21.&lt;/p&gt;
