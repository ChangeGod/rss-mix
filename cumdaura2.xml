                            &lt;p&gt;The major European indices are closing the day mixed/little changed, erasing earlier declines at the start of the US session. The snapshot of the closing levels shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +0.34%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.36%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, +0.06%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.11%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +0.07%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX closed at a new record level. The DAX&apos;s ascent to record levels is attributed to a combination of strong corporate earnings, positive economic indicators, and investor confidence in Germany&apos;s economic resilience. Sectors such as technology, telecommunications, finance, pharmaceuticals, and energy have been at the forefront of this growth, reflecting a diversified and robust market performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK FTSE 100 closed at 8786.47, which is within shouting distance of its record high close from February 28 at 8809.75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex closed at a new high, going back to 2008&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) MORGAN STANLEY: S&amp;P 500 TO RISE, BUT GAINS WILL TAKE TIME

Morgan Stanley expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 6,500 by mid-2026—a 9.5% gain—but says investors will need patience due to high Treasury yields, inflation, and tariff uncertainty.

Key points:

🔸 Gains likely delayed until year-end, driven by Fed rate cuts, deregulation, and a weaker dollar.
🔸 The firm upgraded U.S. stocks to Overweight, citing a resilient global economy.
🔸 Strong Q1 earnings have powered a 19% rally since April lows, but growth is expected to slow in coming quarters.
🔸 Fed rate cuts may not start until September, with more expected in 2026.
🔸 Morgan Stanley sees 10-year yields dropping to 3.45% by mid-2026.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;House Speaker Johnson and House Freedom Caucus Harris will go meet US Pres. Trump this afternoon at 3 PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris earlier today said that they are encouraged by the progress in the last 24 hours, but does not think it can be done today or even this week. He said he is confident he could be done in 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP Hoy commented that there is a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Sherman from PunchBowl is saying that Trump is expected to tell the House Finance Committee, that the bill needs to pass today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market experienced a nuanced day with mixed performances across various sectors. While the technology sector seems to be losing its previous momentum, evidenced by Microsoft (MSFT) declining by 0.44% and Oracle (ORCL) dropping by 0.62%, there is burgeoning resilience in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer cyclical sectors, notably Amazon (AMZN), saw a significant dip of 1.05%. This underperformance highlights consumer caution amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, healthcare stocks like Eli Lilly (LLY) experienced a 1.40% fall, indicating potential reevaluations within drug manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, some areas demonstrated robust growth, with communication services shining as Google (GOOG) surged by 3.53% and Meta (META) rising by 0.71%, reflecting investor confidence in these internet giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market sentiment today reveals a cautious yet optimistic tone. Investors appear increasingly wary of the technology sector&apos;s prospects, likely due to valuation concerns or broader economic signals. The confidence in communication services reflects a strategic pivot towards sectors perceived as more stable or with promising potentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the stability within certain industrial segments suggests that investors are factoring in expected infrastructural developments and potential fiscal policies supporting long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given today&apos;s trends, investors might consider reducing exposure to underperforming tech stocks while exploring opportunities within the communication services sphere. The tech sector&apos;s momentary deceleration necessitates a cautious yet opportunistic approach—watch for signals of recovery or further downturns before making adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resilience within the communication services and some industrial stocks indicates promising growth areas. Strategic diversification, especially into sectors like utilities and basic materials which have shown stability, could hedge against sector-specific volatilities. Investors should remain alert to macroeconomic developments and policy changes that might influence these dynamics, ensuring their portfolios are well-positioned to navigate these transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest updates and detailed analyses, stay connected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; where comprehensive market coverage keeps you informed of every crucial movement.📈&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;187&quot; data-end=&quot;482&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD surged to its highest level since 2022 earlier today, driven by stronger-than-expected UK CPI data that reinforced hawkish rate expectations. The rally took the pair above both the 2024 high at 1.3433 (not shown) and the 2025 high at 1.34419, with the advance stalling at 1.34695.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;484&quot; data-end=&quot;779&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After peaking, the pair pulled back and moved back below those multi-year highs. Buyers turned to sellers, and turned the price back toward a swing area between 1.33619 and 1.33784, but found buyers ahead of the lower boundary, bottoming at 1.3388. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;484&quot; data-end=&quot;779&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price has rebounded in the early US session, and brought price action back into the resistance zone between 1.3423 and 1.3441 - the old highs from 2024/2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;781&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A second break above this resistance area would signal renewed bullish momentum, especially if the pair can pierce and hold above the intraday high at 1.34695. Conversely, failure to extend above 1.3441 or a sharp rejection from current levels could spark further downside pressure, with traders eyeing a return to the 1.3378–1.3362 area as the next potential support zone, followed by the rising 100 hour MA and the 38.2% retracement both currently at 1.33438. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1177&quot; data-end=&quot;1202&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1204&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1204&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1206&quot; data-end=&quot;1221&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1224&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1224&quot; data-end=&quot;1251&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1251&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.34419 – April 2025 high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1254&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1256&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.34695 – Today’s high / highest since 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1302&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3500 – Psychological round number (watch on breakout)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1361&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1363&quot; data-end=&quot;1375&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1378&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1378&quot; data-end=&quot;1429&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1380&quot; data-end=&quot;1429&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3423 – Lower end of swing high area &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1432&quot; data-end=&quot;1467&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1434&quot; data-end=&quot;1467&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.33619 to 1.33784 – Swing area&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1508&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1472&quot; data-end=&quot;1505&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.33438 – 100 hour MA and the 38.2% of the May trading range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1575&quot; data-end=&quot;1667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bullish above 1.3441; bearish tilt if price fails at highs and slips below 1.3362.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;488&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD has experienced a choppy four-day stretch, marked by key technical tests on both ends of the range. After dipping to a low of 0.6391 yesterday—just above the prior support zone near 0.6388 (Thursday/Friday’s lows)—buyers stepped in and defended the level, forming a near-term base. That bounce highlights the 0.6388–0.6391 area as key support, where recent dip-buyers found value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;490&quot; data-end=&quot;706&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound has since taken the pair back above the 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages, both converging near 0.6425, which now represent close support and a barometer for short-term bull/bear bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;708&quot; data-end=&quot;955&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, price has stalled just ahead of the 200-day moving average, currently near 0.6454, which is acting as resistance. A break above that level would open the door for more upside momentum, but for now, buyers face a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;957&quot; data-end=&quot;1055&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In summary, the last four sessions show a market respecting well-defined technical boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support held at multi-day lows (0.6388–0.6391)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1109&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1111&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance formed near the 200-day MA (~0.6454)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1163&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The battle line is now drawn at the 100/200-hour MAs (~0.6425)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1231&quot; data-end=&quot;1246&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.6425 (100/200-hour MAs), 0.6388–0.6391&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1303&quot; data-end=&quot;1348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6454 (200-day MA), 0.6469&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1349&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1351&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral-to-bullish above 0.6425, bearish tilt resumes below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally , yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate to 3.85% from 4.10%, as widely expected, citing easing inflation and a more balanced risk outlook. While headline inflation may temporarily rise, underlying inflation is projected to stay near the midpoint of the 2–3% target range. The RBA noted recovering domestic demand and persistent labor market tightness, but flagged growing uncertainty from global trade tensions and tariffs. Despite the rate cut, the Board remains cautious and emphasized that monetary policy will remain responsive to evolving economic risks both at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut did help to send the pair lower yesterday to the support target, but rallied into the close. Today, the declines from yesterday have been retraced. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;What is happening with the US consumer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the market breathed a sigh of relief after Walmart maintained its annual sales forecast. The CFO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/hard-to-find-any-sign-of-weakness-in-the-us-consumer-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;February was softer than expected, March was back to normal and April was very strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could the signal have been that higher-end consumers who usually shop at Target trading down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TGT is down 7% after missing Q1 revenue estimates. The company also cut its full-year sales outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of that may be because of the DEI dance the company is doing but I find it hard to believe that consumers actually care. The company blamed most of the decline on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales were down nearly 3% compared to a year ago. The company now expects a low-single digit decline in sales this 
fiscal year, compared to a previous forecast of net sales growth of 
about 1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Brian Cornell  said that “ongoing pressure in our discretionary business, plus five consecutive 
months of declining consumer confidence, tariff uncertainty and the 
reaction to the updates we shared on belonging in January.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also remember that consumers haven&apos;t even been hit by tariff price hikes yet. The company said that price hikes are a &quot;last resort&quot; but didn&apos;t rule them out.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD remains under pressure, continuing its slide that began last week after the pair tested and failed at the 200-day moving average on two occasions (higher green line currently at 1.4016). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price traded above and below the 100 and 200 hour MAs over the last two trading days, with the 100 hour MA stalling the last rally yesterday before rotating lower.  When the price fell below the lows from Monday and Tuesday near 1.3917 in the Asian session today, the sellers pushed lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;398&quot; data-end=&quot;728&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Price is now trading to new lows and is testing a key swing level near 1.38607.

Swing levels toward that low would eye 1.3646 and below that the low from April at 1.3780.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;730&quot; data-end=&quot;846&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are in control.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;848&quot; data-end=&quot;863&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;921&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;921&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38607, 1.3825, 1.3749 (2025 low extreme), 1.37415 (61.8% off daily)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;922&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;924&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3891–1.3904, 1.3917 (swing level) 1.3949 (100-hour MA), 1.4016 (200-day MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;999&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 1.3904, downside risks increase on break of 1.3860&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) INVESTORS WORRY ABOUT FISCAL BALANCE BEYOND THE U.S. 

The U.S. isn&apos;t the only country spurring fiscal concerns, Deutsche Bank&apos;s Jim Reid writes. A 20-year bond auction in Japan yesterday had the lowest demand in a decade, he says. Reid points out that the current debt-to-GDP ratio is 100% in the U.S. and the U.K., and 250% in Japan, compared to 41%, 42% and 113%, respectively, in 1999, when Japan introduced its 30-year sovereign bond. &quot;We&apos;ve never had a 30yr plus global bond market before when debt has been this high,&quot; Reid says, adding that &quot;this is uncharted territory.&quot; He says supply will increase in coming years, &quot;so the long-end desperately needs inflation to be controlled.&quot;</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Analyzing forex market
trends is critical for traders aiming to capitalize on currency movements.
Accurate data analysis and the use of advanced trading tools empower traders to
make informed decisions. Understanding key data sources and trading signals enhances
trend analysis, providing a competitive edge in the forex market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic world of
forex trading, staying ahead of market trends can significantly impact your
success. Market trends in forex are patterns or directions that currency values
tend to follow over a period. By understanding these trends, you can better
anticipate future movements and make strategic trading decisions. Utilizing
effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economies.com/best-brokers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;best trading software&lt;/a&gt; can further enhance
your ability to analyze these trends effectively. This article explores the
essential components of forex market trend analysis and the role of advanced
tools in optimizing trading strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding forex market trends &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forex market trends
refer to the general direction in which a currency pair&apos;s value is moving.
Recognizing these trends is vital for traders as it informs their buying and
selling strategies. Trends can be bullish, bearish, or sideways, each offering
unique opportunities and challenges. Bullish trends indicate rising prices,
while bearish trends suggest falling prices. Sideways trends show a lack of
strong directional movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders often rely on
technical analysis to identify these trends, using chart patterns and
indicators to predict future price actions. Understanding the nature of forex
trends allows traders to align their strategies with prevailing market
conditions. By analyzing historical price data, traders can determine potential
entry and exit points that maximize profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful trend
analysis involves more than just recognizing patterns; it requires interpreting
these patterns within the context of broader economic events. Economic
indicators, geopolitical developments, and monetary policies all influence
currency movements. Being aware of these factors helps you understand why a
trend is occurring, enabling you to anticipate changes and adjust your
strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key data sources for trend analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate trend analysis
in the forex market relies heavily on robust data sources. Traders frequently
turn to economic calendars to track upcoming events that could impact currency
valuations. These calendars provide information on interest rate announcements,
employment reports, and other economic indicators that influence forex markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical data
source is historical price charts, which offer insights into past market
behaviors. By studying these charts, traders can identify recurring patterns
and use them to forecast future movements. Technical indicators such as moving
averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence
Divergence) are invaluable tools for analyzing price data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, real-time
news feeds provide up-to-the-minute information on political events and
economic developments worldwide. Staying informed about global events helps
traders understand market sentiment and potential impacts on currency values.
Combining these data sources creates a comprehensive picture of market
conditions, enabling more precise trend predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing trading signals for decision-making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading signals play a
crucial role in interpreting forex market trends and guiding trading decisions.
These signals are generated by analyzing technical indicators and identifying
potential buy or sell opportunities based on specific criteria. They help you
pinpoint optimal times to enter or exit trades, maximizing profit potential
while minimizing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different
types of trading signals, including manual signals provided by experienced
analysts and automated signals generated by algorithms. Manual signals rely on
human expertise to interpret market data and suggest actions. In contrast,
automated signals use pre-set criteria within trading software to generate
alerts when conditions align with predefined parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of
trading signals depends on their accuracy and timeliness. To ensure reliable
outcomes, it&apos;s essential to evaluate the credibility of signal providers or the
algorithms used in generating them. Reliable signals enhance your decision-making
process by providing clear guidance amid volatile market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of advanced trading tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economies.com/best-brokers/forex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; best
forex trading platform&lt;/a&gt; will offer a wide range of tools for
traders. Advanced trading tools have revolutionized how traders analyze forex
market trends. These sophisticated platforms offer features such as real-time
analytics, customizable charts, and automated strategies that streamline the
trading process. They enable you to quickly assess large volumes of data and
make informed decisions with greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One significant
advantage of advanced trading tools is their ability to integrate various data
sources seamlessly. By consolidating information from different channels into a
single interface, they provide a holistic view of the market landscape. This integration
simplifies trend analysis by presenting comprehensive insights at your
fingertips.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of automation
within these tools also enhances efficiency by executing trades based on
predetermined criteria without manual intervention. This capability allows you
to capitalize on opportunities instantly while reducing emotional bias in
decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;345&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF has rotated lower today, continuing the decline over the last 6 or so trading days..  The price has returned to a familiar swing area between 0.8193 and 0.8212, which has previously acted as the low of an up-and-down trading range (see Red Box). The pair found buyers on the initial test, with price bouncing modestly toward another swing area between 0.8272 and 0.82803.  This area is now close resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;347&quot; data-end=&quot;607&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above this zone would shift focus toward the falling 100-hour moving average at 0.83316, followed by the 200-hour MA at 0.83591, both of which represent key upside hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;609&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Until then, the bearish bias remains in place with the descending trendline and moving averages acting as a ceiling. A break back below the lower end of the swing area at 0.8193 would open the door for further downside probing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;846&quot; data-end=&quot;861&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;891&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;891&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8212, 0.8193&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;969&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;894&quot; data-end=&quot;969&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8272–0.8280, 0.8332 (100-hour MA), 0.8359 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;970&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;972&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.8280, bullish potential above 0.8332&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Will the buyers defend 5% yields once again? The red flags are flying</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things going on in the economy, trade and politics at the moment that are worth watching closely but I believe the confluence of them all -- and the single most important metric to watch -- is the yield on long bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we&apos;ve seen three tests of 5% and they were all met by buyers, including early this week after the debt downgrade. But this time the buying momentum faded quickly and yields are up 5.5 bps to 5.02%. If we can close above 5% (especially on the weekly), that&apos;s a good sign that the buyers are exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, we could very quickly be talking about the 2023 high of 5.17%. That came at a time when Liz Truss was blowing up the UK economy and US inflation was out of control. It was also in a much stronger (at least nominally) economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this is a worrisome signal that&apos;s a problem for risk assets and it&apos;s a red flag that the US dollar is down today even as yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that 10-year yields are still within the 2025 range and have some decent breathing room ahead of the January high of 4.81%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest rate to prevent inflation from falling under 2% may have to come below the neutral rate between 1.50-2.00%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing 1.64% as the low for ECB rates which is a bit more than 50 bps fully priced in. Getting helow his neutral range would mean at least one more cut on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;

The latest CPI number drastically cut the odds of a BOC rate cut in June (odds now just 31%) and Canadian yields are following the global trend higher.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD moved higher to a new high going back to 2022 after hotter than expected CPI data, but has reversed lower.  The pair is back below the 2024 hgh at 1.3433, and the 2025 high from April at 1.3441 after spiking to 1.34695.  Staying below those levels will keep the sellers in play. Move above and we should resume the upside momentum to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EUR and JPY are also higher vs the USD (the USD is lower) to start the US trading day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video above, I take a look at the price action and the technicals that are driving the price action to start the US trading session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the UK inflation, it surprised to the upside in April, with headline CPI rising by 3.5% year-over-year (vs 3.3% expected, prior 2.6%). Core CPI climbed to 3.8% (vs 3.6% expected), and services inflation surged to 5.4% (vs 4.8% expected), pointing to persistent underlying pressures. The stronger-than-expected data significantly dents hopes for aggressive rate cuts from the Bank of England, with markets now pricing in just one 25 bp cut by year-end—if that. The report reinforces the view that inflation, not weak growth, is the dominant risk facing central banks, aligning with similar concerns for the ECB and the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECB&apos;s Centeno said the interest rate to prevent inflation from falling under 2%, may have to come below the neutral rate between 1.5% and 2.0%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late yesterday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack spoke and expressed concern over recent sentiment data, noting it reflects unease about the economic outlook. She emphasized that the Fed faces a tough balancing act if both inflation and unemployment become problematic. Hammack stressed the importance of monitoring how business decisions are affected by trade policies, and for now, believes the Fed’s best course is to “sit on its hands” and evaluate data closely while engaging with communities. She added that inflation expectations remain well-anchored, but any shift in those expectations could prompt the Fed to take action. &quot;Uncertainty&quot; is the key theme for Fed officials.  The undercurrent is the fear of inflation but the economy matters too. So eyes are pealed to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US MBA mortgage applications fell sharply by 5.1% in the week ending May 16, reversing the prior week’s 1.1% gain - and then some. The decline was broad-based, with the market index dropping to 238.5 (from 251.2), the purchase index down to 157.8 (from 166.5), and the refinance index slipping to 682.5 (from 718.1). Meanwhile, the average 30-year mortgage rate rose slightly to 6.92% from 6.86%, likely contributing to the pullback in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic calendar only shows Canada new housing price index for April and the weekly EIA crude oil inventory data. Late yesterday the private data showed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are lower with the futures implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures are down -325 points after falling -114.83 points or -0.27% yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures are implying a decline of -35 points after yesterday&apos;s -23.14 points or -0.39% decline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures are implying a decline of -131 points after falling -72.75 points or -0.38%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets, the major indices are lower at the start of the US session:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, -0.21%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.66% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, -0.02%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.36%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, -0.24%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields higher with the yield curve steepening. The two-year yield to his back of 4%. The 30-year yield is back above 5%:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.002%, +3.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.119%, +5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.544%, +6.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 5.035%, +6.8 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil up $0.65 at $62.86&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is up $20.44 or 0.62% at $3310.34&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $353 at $106,502. Intraday high price reached $108,035&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The newsflow was extremely limited and we got no data other than the UK CPI report. The UK inflation figures beat expectations by a big margin and triggered a repricing in interest rates expectations with the market now favouring just one rate cut in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global long term yields remain elevated as bond traders might not only worry about debts now but also about inflation as central banks continue to downplay inflation risks and focus more on the growth part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final part of the session we also got the news that Republicans have reached an agreement to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, which was one of the final hurdles holding up Trump&apos;s &quot;big, beautiful bill&quot;. The House Speaker has also said that they could vote on the bill tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US House Speaker Johnson said that they reached an agreement on the $40,000 SALT deduction cap. Hardline conservatives have been resistant to a significant hike to the deduction cap. This should be a big step forward in passing the party’s “big, beautiful bill.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A congressional correspondent with CNN posted on X that the House Speaker said they will try to vote tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Stock Market Guides, a company that offers stock market
scanning software, has announced the latest improvement to its proprietary
stock scanner technology. Their stock scanner not only finds trade setups in
real time that are popular among active traders, but it also now shows how each
of those trade setups performed historically according to backtest research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Andy Yuda, a Senior Consultant at Stock Market
Guides, &quot;One example of a scan we offer is for oversold stocks based on
their RSI indicator. It&apos;s a popular trade setup for many active stock traders.
Before you pull the trigger on buying a stock that&apos;s oversold, wouldn’t you
want to know how that stock has performed historically when it’s been oversold?
If that stock doesn&apos;t have a track record of success historically for that
trade setup, why buy it now? That historical performance is the information our
scanner brings to light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technology is available not only for active stock
traders, but also for buy-and-hold investors as well as option traders. The
scanner at Stock Market Guides caters to trade setups based on technical
analysis, like chart patterns and stock indicators, as well as investments
based on fundamental analysis, like price-to-earnings ratios and earnings
growth.Customers
can also enable the scanner to pick trades for them. This is offered for both
stocks and stock options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scanner technology upgrade is the latest feature that
Stock Market Guides has made available to retail investors.  They also
offer free educational guides that cover everything from how to buy stocks all
the way to how to calculate advanced stock market indicator values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Guides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock Market Guides
is based in Altadena, California, and has been offering stock scanning services
to the public since 2023. Prior to that, its founders did years of research and
development that led to the creation of the business and its offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Stock Market Guides and its
range of educational content and services, users can visit

educational content aimed at supporting informed financial decision-making for

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ECB will soon reach terminal rate if baseline holds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest rate cuts are nearing an end assuming inflation stabilises at 2% over the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s important to analise alternative scenarios amid the trade uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If either inflationary or deflationary risk scenario materialises, monetary policy will react accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market sees the terminal rate for the ECB around 1.75%, which is equivalent to two more 25 bps cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;1:1-1:164&quot;&gt;Prepare to be astonished. Google DeepMind just unveiled Veo 3, a video generation model that is, quite literally, mind-blowing. We&apos;ve never seen anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;3:1-3:325&quot;&gt;Veo can generate high-definition, 8-second videos complete with incredibly realistic and perfectly synchronized audio. Forget heavily curated demos – here  Dr. Furkan Gözükara, a PhD Computer Engineer, gathered 60 un-cherry-picked examples from users on Twitter. Because let&apos;s be real, seeing what people are actually creating is the true test of any hyped-up release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;6:1-6:95&quot;&gt;🔗 Official website: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; externallink=&quot;&quot; jslog=&quot;197247;track:generic_click,impression;BardVeMetadataKey:[[r_907bc73730036066,c_2b1c4b68ac1a3bad,null,rc_b10ecef143cda07c,null,null,en,null,1,null,null,1,0]]&quot; href=&quot;https://deepmind.google/models/veo/&quot; class=&quot;ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;https://deepmind.google/models/veo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks to Short as Hollywood Film Making Might Be Disrupted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always do your own research, we at ForexLive.com do not provide financial advice but our experts continue to give you wonderful &apos;heads up&apos;, early in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Disruption in Hollywood: Top Stocks to Short Amid Google&apos;s Veo3 Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence continues to disrupt major industries, and Hollywood is no exception. Recent advancements, especially Google&apos;s unveiling of Veo3 and its Flow filmmaking tool, mark a significant turning point in movie production economics. High-quality filmmaking capabilities that previously required substantial financial investments are becoming widely accessible, posing severe threats to traditional film studios and entertainment stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google&apos;s Veo3 and Flow: Revolutionizing Film Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Google I/O 2025, the technology giant introduced Veo3, an advanced AI-powered video creation tool developed by DeepMind. Veo3 allows users—including independent creators, filmmakers, and businesses—to generate professional-grade videos simply through text or image prompts. Its ability to integrate realistic sound effects, dialogue, and accurate lip-sync and movements significantly surpasses previous AI models, bringing professional filmmaking capabilities into the hands of everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing Veo3, Google also launched Flow, an intuitive filmmaking platform designed specifically for creatives. Flow empowers storytellers to effortlessly produce cinematic-quality scenes and short films. The tool, supported by Google&apos;s Gemini AI models, translates everyday language prompts into stunningly realistic visual outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks to Short Due to AI Disruption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The democratization of film production brought on by Veo3 and similar AI tools threatens several legacy media and entertainment companies, making their stocks potential targets for short sellers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramount is highly reliant on conventional TV channels and traditional film production methods. Its slower transition to digital-first streaming, combined with limited financial adaptability, makes it particularly susceptible to rapid market share loss driven by AI-enhanced competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMC depends heavily on theatrical movie releases. The proliferation of high-quality AI-generated home entertainment could significantly decrease theater attendance, exacerbating AMC&apos;s already tenuous financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE: LGF.A)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate, as a smaller, independent film studio without strong digital distribution channels, is especially vulnerable. The company&apos;s reliance on expensive, conventional filmmaking methods places it directly at risk from AI-driven video creation technologies, potentially undermining its entire business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix Could Gain from AI Advancements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) appears well-positioned to benefit from the AI-driven disruption. With its robust digital-first approach, Netflix can leverage AI tools like Veo3 to significantly reduce production costs. The future of filmmaking may shift substantially toward lower-cost AI-assisted productions managed by skilled prompt engineers and compelling storytelling teams, offering Netflix a substantial competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical Analysis: Lions Gate Stock at Critical Juncture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is one example you can check out. From a technical standpoint, Lions Gate&apos;s stock currently shows a downward-sloping channel, which could traditionally signal a bullish flag. However, caution is warranted. A decisive break below the critical support range of $6.40-$6.50 could trigger significant bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market sentiment toward Lions Gate has already turned increasingly negative following Google&apos;s Veo3 announcement. The stock has recently struggled around mid-channel resistance levels, making it an attractive candidate for short sellers monitoring technical indicators closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Orientation for Investors Associated With AI-powered Video&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should pay close attention to both technical setups and fundamental vulnerabilities. Lions Gate provides an illustrative example of the kind of stock vulnerable to short selling in response to AI disruption in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the AI landscape evolves, investors and traders must adapt quickly, conducting thorough due diligence into companies&apos; strategic resilience or vulnerability to AI-driven shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminder: ForexLive.com is evolving into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investinglive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;investingLive.com&lt;/a&gt; later this year, expanding its market coverage and offering enhanced decision support tools, market insights, and live financial analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Always invest and trade at your own risk.

You can have bonds selling-off because the central bank is tightening monetary policy or you can have an FX pair in an uptrend because the central bank of the currency that is appreciating is raising interest rates, while the central bank of the currency that is depreciating is cutting rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;tweet mt-2 ng-binding&quot; ng-bind-html=&quot;secure(th.tweet, tweet)&quot;&gt;You can also have various equity sectors responding in different ways to economic events with cyclical stocks falling during hard times and defensive stocks rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;tweet mt-2 ng-binding&quot; ng-bind-html=&quot;secure(th.tweet, tweet)&quot;&gt;When you build your trading idea you should find a market where your idea can be expressed in the best possible way giving you the highest return for the risk taken. This process will also keep you disciplined as you will look only for the highest conviction trades and refrain from taking trades just out of boredom. Remember that your job is not to trade but to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller once said that one of the reasons for his success was that he was lucky to travel across asset classes. He traded commodities, currencies, bonds and equities and it gave him the discipline to trade only what he had the highest conviction in. If he didn&apos;t have a good idea in equities, he was happy to have no equities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;tweet mt-2 ng-binding&quot; ng-bind-html=&quot;secure(th.tweet, tweet)&quot;&gt;Imagine you have two central banks beginning to tighten their monetary policy and the risk sentiment picture is murky. Given that, you may have the corresponding FX pair just ranging and not giving you any high probability trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;tweet mt-2 ng-binding&quot; ng-bind-html=&quot;secure(th.tweet, tweet)&quot;&gt;What you can do though is to trade the country&apos;s government bonds as a tighter policy will cause a drop in those securities. In this way you reduce your risk and increase your chances of success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;tweet mt-2 ng-binding&quot; ng-bind-html=&quot;secure(th.tweet, tweet)&quot;&gt;With more experience you’ll start to notice that when you have high conviction in your trade, because you clearly see the reasons for taking a position, your psychological pressure will be much lower compared to the times when you force trades trying to outsmart the market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In prop trading, factors like developing a strong psychology and mindset are as important in reaching financial goals as a successful strategy. Award-winning firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ultimatetraders.com/?utm_source=publishers&amp;amp;utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_content=homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Ultimate Traders&lt;/a&gt; recognises this and prioritises this within its growing community by providing the education, tools, and technology for each challenge participant to trade at their own pace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This is not the only way the company is innovative in its relationship with its clients. As a younger, tech-savvy group, it not only wants to get funded to trade, it also believes in genuine partnership. In its funded trader program, the firm supports freedom of trading styles while focusing on reliable resources for traders that enable them to exchange ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The shift in broker-trader relations led by the prop company is rippling across the industry, moving the focus away from isolated, high-pressure environments to platforms that foster trading groups, ongoing education, and shared experiences of the ups and downs in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Prop firm challenge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To take on a market challenge, Ultimate Traders sees educational resources as a priority, not an afterthought. As one of the best prop trading firms, it offers structured learning which is tailored to individual needs, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● Strategy guides and psychological performance modules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● Real-time trade analysis and video walkthroughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● Access to experienced mentors for performance reviews and risk management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;● Regularly updated materials driven by feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This approach ensures traders are equipped not just to participate, but to excel and adapt as markets evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Mentoring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Group solidarity is recognised as a catalyst for trader growth. The prop firm has invested in interactive spaces such as its dedicated, private Discord servers where traders at all levels can share insights, discuss strategies, and support one another. Whether someone is looking for prop trading for beginners or is an experienced trader, the resources for improvement and growth are all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Weekly sessions, trade recaps, and mental resilience discussions help to build a culture of collaboration. Mentorship teams, often composed of experienced traders, provide hands-on guidance, clarify rules, and celebrate milestones - going far beyond traditional customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There are also plans to explore in-person meet-ups and build a trader advisory panel with active traders. By sharing daily trading experience, they could offer valuable feedback to boost an even more dynamic evolution in the prop trading industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Awards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In pursuing its goal to identify talented traders, Ultimate Traders has won several awards, including Most Transparent Prop Firm (2024) and Best Prop Trading Firm (2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ultimate Traders review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The company’s testimonials on Trustpilot often have five stars, highlighting fast payouts, fair pricing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ultimatetraders.com/?utm_source=publishers&amp;amp;utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_content=homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;a smooth, organised challenge process, and the clarity of trading rules&lt;/a&gt;. Endorsements like the following reinforce the value of a transparent experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“I am pretty new to prop trading and I appreciate their effort in making the rules as clear as possible. There is nothing that is left behind, just navigate to the Trading Rules page on their website and here everything you need to know is displayed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jamala A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Instant funding prop firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There are no ongoing membership fees - just a one-time, refundable fee for challenge participation. This model removes barriers and allows traders to focus on developing their skills and strategies in their own time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“Legit prop firm that actually paid out. First, I passed the 50k challenge and got funded. Then, I got a successful streak of trades and applied for a payout. They processed it fast.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Lillian H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“I didn’t expect to see prices for all those funded accounts so cheap. I thought it would cost me a fortune. Obviously, I chose a classic challenge and bought a funded account with a balance of $25,000 for $169. I would have never thought that it’s possible to buy a funded account for such a low price. The transaction was through a bank card and everything went pretty smoothly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jose R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Flexible and inclusive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The new trading landscape is defined by flexibility and inclusivity. The company offers a range of challenges and funding opportunities. These fit diverse styles, from scalping and day trading to swing and algorithmic strategies, and are available to traders from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Profit-sharing arrangements are also evolving, with some enabling retention of up to 90% of gains, and the chance to scale up to substantially funded accounts. This alignment of interests encourages long-term commitment and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Technology and market access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;State-of-the-art platforms, such as MetaTrader 4, provide advanced charting, algorithmic trading capabilities, and access across devices. Those who trade with firm capital can engage with hundreds of instruments, including forex, commodities, metals, indices, and shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Today, the forex prop firm redefines a successful partnership with traders as dynamic mutual personal and professional growth. By combining transparency, robust education, flexible opportunities, and a strong sense of community, they are setting new standards for what participants can expect. On Ultimate Traders’ platform, sustainable strategies are built on continuous learning and genuine support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Join the challenge on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ultimatetraders.com/?utm_source=publishers&amp;amp;utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_content=homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
