                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;62&quot; data-end=&quot;338&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD is currently trading near a critical technical zone defined by a convergence of major moving averages. The 100-hour MA, 200-hour MA, and the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart are tightly grouped between 0.5956 and 0.5965, creating a key barometer area for traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;340&quot; data-end=&quot;474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This cluster has acted as a pivot in recent sessions, and price action around this zone will be crucial in determining near-term bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;476&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;476&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;478&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hold above 0.5965 keeps buyers in the game, with eyes on the 0.5994-0.6003 resistance zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;574&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;576&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Break below 0.5956 and stay below would shift momentum in favor of sellers. 0.5943 (low from yesterday&apos;s trade). 0.5893. Corrective low from last week&apos;s trading and lowest level going back to April 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;726&quot; data-end=&quot;789&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum will likely follow the break. Watch this zone closely.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When tariff policies settle out, it&apos;s too early to say what will be the implications for the economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says &quot;I don&apos;t think we know&quot; how long it will take to understand risks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economy has been resilient and is in good shape&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don&apos;t think we need to be in a hurry, the data may move quickly or slowly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;ve had &apos;decent&apos; readings in housing services prices and non-housing services prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is still much we don&apos;t know&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The costs of waiting to see further are fairly low.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When we can make a better assessment we can move quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked if the Fed will cut at all says they don&apos;t know, there are cases they wouldn&apos;t cut at all and cases where cutting would be appropriate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty about the economy is extremely elevated and that the downside risks have increased, both higher unemployment and higher inflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s obvious that the right thing for us to do is &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 2024 rate cuts weren&apos;t preemptive. &quot;If anything, it was a little late.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Businesses and households are concerned and postponing decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If nothing alleviates those decisions, you would expect it to eventually show up in data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think we can wait and move when it&apos;s clear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are feeling stress but unemployment hasn&apos;t gone up, initial jobless claims are not increasing in any kind of impressive way&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of a June rate cut are down to 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

The market may be getting some solace from the confident tone from Powell on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

It also explained away the GDP report.&lt;/p&gt;

The big part of the statement was that &quot;The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow up 41 points or 0.10% have 40870&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -22.23 points or -0.40% at 5584.06&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -159.93 points or -0.90% at 17830.21.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yields have moved lower as the market reacts to the thought the Fed will keep rates unchanged for too long.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield -2.3 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield -3.8 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield -5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield -5.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDJPY is moved down and back toward its 100 bar moving out on the 4-hour chart at 142.847. The low price of just reached 142.897.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;83&quot; data-end=&quot;409&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD has been fluctuating around its 200-hour moving average at 1.13456 in today’s trading but continues to hold above the rising 100-hour moving average at 1.13281—giving buyers a modest technical advantage. A break below the 100-hour moving average would be needed to tilt the bias more firmly to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;411&quot; data-end=&quot;643&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As long as the pair holds above that level, attention turns to the upside. Immediate resistance lies near the trendline around 1.1385, followed by the April 30 high at 1.14027 and then the high from last week at 1.14238.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A reporter asked Trump:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you open to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table?&quot;

Trump replied : &quot;No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t take this at face value. What&apos;s he going to say? Yes he is? Before the meeting in Switzerland on the weekend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t have to have studied The Art of the Deal to know that you shouldn&apos;t make an offer through the media before a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He talked about Gaza and India as well and the only other comments on the trade war were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he doesn&apos;t know on tariff exemptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will take a look at tariff exemptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These comments and the more-hawkish lines from the Fed are weighing on stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;March 19May 07,
2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250319a.htm&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250507a.htm&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although swings in net exports have affected the
data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has
continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a
low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation
remains somewhat elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and
inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty aroundabout
the economic outlook has increased further.
The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate
and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have
risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain
the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In
considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue
reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency
mortgage‑backed securities. Beginning in
April, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings
by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion
to $5 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. The
Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning
inflation to its 2 percent objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the
Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for
the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of
monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment
of the Committee&apos;s goals. The Committee&apos;s assessments will take into account a
wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions,
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international
developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell,
Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan
M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel
Kashkari; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; and Jeffrey
R. Schmid. Voting against this action was Christopher J. Waller,
who supported no change for the federal funds target range but preferred to
continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings..
Neel Kashkari voted as an alternate member at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

The statement highlights something that Powell has been saying: That risks to both sides of the mandate have risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a short statement and doesn&apos;t offer much color so we will have to wait for Powell at 2:30 pm ET. The market reaction to the decision has been muted across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump has a long wish list for tax cuts in Congress this year and GOP leaders are aiming to pass the bill by July 4 but it won&apos;t be easy. The deficit is already at 7% of GDP and growth is slowing. In addition, the tax cuts will slash government revenue as interest payments continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where will the savings come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punchbowl &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndrewDesiderio/status/1920165119692038480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Significant change of tune from Senate GOP leaders who said at their closed-door retreat that House isn’t being aggressive enough on spending cuts &amp;amp; should still consider FMAP reductions to maximize Medicaid savings, per 3 attendees&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMAP is the share of Medicaid payments that the Federal government pays. This comes after Speaker Johnson said FMAP reductions were probably off the table after meeting with moderates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the signature bill of Trump&apos;s second term but Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this ultimately end with a huge deficit and promises that it will &apos;pay for itself&apos; but the bond market won&apos;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;

Structural uncertainty and expectations of economic slowdown continue to weigh on the dollar, even as rate differentials have shifted modestly in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;411&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;587&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;415&quot; data-end=&quot;587&quot;&gt;No policy change expected:The Fed is set to leave rates unchanged, so focus shifts entirely to the tone of the statement and Powell’s press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;589&quot; data-end=&quot;807&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;591&quot; data-end=&quot;807&quot;&gt;Economic language in focus:March’s statement described the economy and labor market as “solid.” With Q1 GDP contracting by 0.3%, markets will watch whether this language softens—a change would be dovish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;809&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;811&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot;&gt;Jobs market likely still “solid”:The April NFP gain of 177k was better than expected, even accounting for prior downward revisions, which should help preserve the Fed’s current jobs assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1023&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1025&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot;&gt;Market ignoring rate spreads:Despite a 10bp move in the 2-year EU-US spread in favor of the USD since April, EUR/USD is up nearly 5%, suggesting rate differentials are not driving FX right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1241&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1243&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;Sentiment and uncertainty dominate:With widespread concerns about a weaker economy and persistent trade/tariff-related uncertainty, MUFG believes that a hawkish Powell is unlikely to reverse USD weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1792&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1792&quot;&gt;MUFG cautions that expecting a dollar rally from today’s FOMC may be misplaced.

DOGE efforts which were at first targeting $2T of cuts has been slashed to $1T and lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of May 2025, the DOGE, led by Elon Musk under the Trump administration, reports achieving approximately $160 billion in federal spending cuts. These reductions stem from various measures, including workforce downsizing, contract terminations, and program eliminations.  However, it is still unsure how much the government has saved given other costs from the cuts including severance costs and other intangible costs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pres. Trump sees tariffs as a way to add more to the Treasury as well and reduce debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;When there is a revolution, there are a lot of uncertainties. The comment that the Treasury Secretary &quot;believes&quot;, inserts an element of uncertainty from the revolutionary changes that are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bessent adds ahead of the Fed decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fed should focus on both price and employment goals. Inflation and employment are in inexorably linked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs for items that parents need to care for their children are under consideration.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

In response, Apple is reportedly exploring the integration of AI-powered search capabilities into its browsers—a potential shift that poses a direct threat to Alphabet, which benefits from a lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Apple for default Google searches on iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alphabet shares are taking a major hit on the news, falling $-13.65 or -8.41% at $149.50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the initial selloff pushed the stock back below its 50-day moving average at $160.66, and more importantly, below the 38.2% retracement of the rally from the November 2022 low ($83.34) to the February 2025 high ($207.05) at $159.79. From its peak, Alphabet is now down 27.5%, and it has lost 20.71% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;930&quot; data-end=&quot;1053&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the stock remains above the 2025 low of $140.53 (set on April 7), the next technical support levels to watch are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$147.22 – swing low from September 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1100&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1102&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$145.20 – 50% retracement of the Nov 2022–Feb 2025 rally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is room to roam to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sharp move underscores growing investor concern as AI alternatives like ChatGPT continue to disrupt traditional search behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a day of reckoning for Alphabet. They need to evolve. They will not go away but the cash cow is hurting and the data seems to be supporting it.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, AUDUSD briefly pushed above the 0.6504 swing high from early December 2024, but the breakout failed to gain traction, and the pair has since reversed lower (see 4-hour chart above). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inability to hold above that key resistance level suggests buyers lacked the momentum to drive the next leg higher and has helped lead to more selling today from a technical perspective.  .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;698&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the pair is trading lower and retesting the 200-day moving average 9higher green line on the chart below), currently at 0.6460. A break below that level and the 100-hour MA at 0.6452, would open the door for a look toward the 200-hour MA at 0.6428 coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;700&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is also a swing area between 0.6429 and 0.6442 will be key for determining short-term direction. Holding this zone could offer buyers a base for another attempt higher. A break below, however, would shift the bias more clearly in favor of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;963&quot; data-end=&quot;987&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6504 (failed breakout zone), 0.6514 (new high for 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1036&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1038&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.6460 (200-day MA), 0.6452 (100-hour MA), 0.6428 (200-hour MA), 0.6429–0.6442 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Apple VP of services Eddie Cue is saying that Apple is exploring adding AI to search browsers. The comments seem to have turned the stock market. The NASDAQ is now down around -59 points or -0.33% at 17631. The S&amp;amp;P is also dipping into negative territory..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google have been impacted by the announcement. It&apos;s shares are down -$7.61 or -4.5% to $156.00. Microsoft shares are down -1 dollar or -0.25% to $432.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple pays Google a fee every time a user clicks on Google. Hence the decline in Google shares. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ is reporting that tariffs could lift laptop and phone prices by some 30% according to some forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know.... Rising prices by 30% is still a threat to cost-push inflationinfluences.  The line that inflation from tariffs will only be a one time price increase may not be that.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a vibrant rally, particularly in the consumer cyclical sector, with Amazon (AMZN) leading the way with an impressive gain of 3.11%. The sector showcases robust investor sentiment, driven by optimistic forecasts and strong consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the technology sector shows moderate yet consistent gains, with Microsoft (MSFT) up by 0.46%, highlighting steady confidence in tech-driven growth. On the flip side, the energy sector faces challenges, as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) both post a decline of 0.53%, reflecting ongoing volatility in oil and gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market mood is cautiously optimistic, with significant gains in consumer and tech stocks mitigating losses in more volatile sectors like energy and industrials. Investors appear to be capitalizing on consumer cyclical opportunities, while tech&apos;s consistent performance suggests long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, healthcare shows modest growth with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) up 0.30%, indicating sustained interest in defensive plays amid market fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the current market dynamics, investors might consider reinforcing their portfolios with strong consumer cyclical and tech stocks to leverage the ongoing rally. AMZN and TSLA, showing gains of 3.11% and 0.43% respectively, could be beneficial additions for those eyeing potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, caution is advised regarding energy stocks, as ongoing global concerns may continue to exert downward pressure. Investors should stay informed with evolving market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, today&apos;s market landscape offers diverse opportunities, bolstered by consumer confidence and tech stability. Staying abreast of real-time market data on ForexLive.com will equip investors to navigate these dynamic conditions effectively. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil inventories -2.032 million versus estimate -0.833 million. The private API data released late yesterday showed a draw of -4.49 million &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasoline inventories build  of +0.188 million versus drawdown of -1.600 million estimate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distillates inventories draw of-1.107 million versus estimate of -1.271 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are the weekly API inventory data released late yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil is trading down $0.46 at $58.62. The high price today reached $60.22. The low price is at $58.59. Looking at the hourly chart, the price is approaching its rising 100 hour moving average of $58.26. Earlier today, the price moved above its 200-hour moving average (green line in the chart below) currently at $59.70. It also extended about the 50% midpoint of the move down from the April 23 high. That level comes in at $60.08. However, momentum about the 50% midpoint level and the natural resistance at $60, faded fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

Momentum above the 100- and 200-hour moving averages has repeatedly faded, highlighting persistent selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;393&quot; data-end=&quot;692&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since mid-late April, price action has carved out a sideways range, with the support zone between 0.8195 and 0.8212 holding on multiple tests.

Until then, sellers remain in control, and downside probes into the lower support zone remain a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices are trading higher in early US trading. The gains were helped by the US/China meeting news, but the levels are lower than premarket levels implied by the futures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow industrial average is leading the way with a gain of 0.56%. The S&amp;amp;P index is up 0.47% and the NASDAQ index is up 0.40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Bessent will be speaking on Capitol Hill. His comments are expected to begin very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices remain just above their rising 50 hour moving average. For the S&amp;amp;P index the 50 arm of which is at 5596.31. The low price today raised 5613.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the NASDAQ index it&apos;s 50 hour moving averages at 17622.12. They low price reached 17689.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the indices also held above the moving average which increases the levels importance from a technical perspective. If there is a break look for momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have markets created immunity to bad news?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Time is ticking, but the tariff war remains unclear with
Donald Trump suddenly declaring that he does not plan to talk to Xi Jinping
this week, and adding that China is “stealing” from the U.S. In short, there is
still no trade deal in sight between the two world powers, which is not good
news for markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the US rejected Japan&apos;s request to lift
tariffs altogether, a move that did not please investors either. As a result,
both the Nasdaq and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SPX/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P
500 started the week in the red&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly expected
reaction. Who knows, we may see another rally in Treasury yields if the deal
fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, however, markets have followed a similar
pattern: an initial wave of pessimism followed by a rebound. Some see this as
reminiscent of the Biden era. The problem is that back then, investors were
pinning their hopes on the next interest rate cut, which now seems less likely
as inflation risks increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the “buy the dips” approach last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start by remembering that past performance does not
guarantee future results. Therefore, expecting the rally to continue just
because it has happened in the past is a risky bet. Moreover, analysts don&apos;t
seem too confident that recent gains will be sustained, as trade wars have
already hurt the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not just the drop in GDP in the first quarter, caused
mainly by a widening trade deficit due to increased imports by businesses
before tariffs went into effect, but the fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-plunges-april-2025-04-29/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20April%2029%20(Reuters),lowest%20reading%20since%20May%202020.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;U.S.
consumer confidence index fell&lt;/a&gt; to 86.0 in April from
93.9 previously. The current situation index also fell to 133.5 from 134.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the U.S. S&amp;amp;P Global Composite PMI index fell to
50.6 in April from 53.5 in March, its lowest reading since September 2023.
Business expectations fell to their lowest level in two and a half years, and
employment numbers were virtually flat. Not surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;XAUUSD is returning to an uptrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this increasingly points to a slowdown in the
economic cycle, and worse, it may be accompanied by a pickup in inflation due
to tariffs. This would likely push the Fed to adopt a more aggressive monetary
policy. In the short term, this should raise doubts about current market
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing: macroeconomic uncertainty makes it
difficult for companies to provide clear guidance. Take Tesla, for example. In
its latest earnings report, the company declined to give a full-year outlook,
saying it would wait until second-quarter results to update investors, and
money doesn&apos;t like unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the bottom line? Keep your eyes open and be prepared
for possible turnarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;VP Vance is speaking and says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security posture of last 20 years is not adequate for the next 20 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think Russians are asking for too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would like Russians and Ukrainians to agree to guidelines for talking to each other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a big gulf between where Ukrainians and Russians are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probably impossible to mediate this without at least some direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No conversation between US and China about a strategic deal of Taiwan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think China will have to let their population consume more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open to having conversations with friends and more adversarial national about rebalancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think we can do that while preserving dialogue with China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversations are ongoing with EU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We want European markets to be open to American goods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think we can have a better trading relationship with your pants if they would drop trade barriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think there is a deal that would reintegrate Iran into global economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would be open to sitting down with Russia and China to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far so good on negotiations with Iran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iran can have civil nuclear power&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump thinks goal should be 5% spending on defense and NATO&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments - as presented - are different in that they seem not to be &quot;Pres Trump wants&quot; but &quot;We think&quot;. A lot of the times, the members of the administration preface most comments with &quot;The President wants to...&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just an interesting shift which I may be overempasizing, but....&lt;/p&gt;
