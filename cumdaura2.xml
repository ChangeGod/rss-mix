                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 724K (revised to 670K)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales monthly change 10.9% vs +7.4% prior (revised to +2.6%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising long-term yields and borrowing costs aren&apos;t helping the housing market. Shares of home builders have struggled badly this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a surprising number but it looks like some sales have simply been shifted by a month as the March number was revised far lower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) 🚨 INDIA &amp; U.S. NEAR TRADE DEAL BREAKTHROUGH

Sources tell CNBC-TV18 that India and the U.S. may reach an initial trade agreement within 7–10 days. Key highlights:

🔸 The U.S. is expected to partially exempt Indian goods from the 26% reciprocal tariffs.

🔸 A 10% tariff may be imposed on Indian imports, with zero duties on select product lines.

🔸 Trump&apos;s proposed 25% tariff on Apple phones is unlikely to affect Apple’s manufacturing operations in India.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think there is any secret on what&apos;s happening between the US and EU at the moment; Bessent spelled it out. He said the EU has been moving too slowly on trade and Trump wants to &apos;light a fire&apos; under the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was strategically timed ahead of a call today that was scheduled previously. At 12:30 pm ET, there is a call scheduled between EU trade boss Sefcovic and USA counterpart Greer will take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will be waiting for a read-out (or leak) from that call afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) 🔸 40% DOLLAR DROP COULD ERASE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT: DEUTSCHE BANK

Deutsche Bank’s Peter Hooper says undoing the dollar’s 40% real rise over the past 15 years could eliminate the U.S. trade deficit. The dollar has already fallen 8.3% this year as Trump’s aggressive tariffs shake investor confidence. More declines are possible, but could bring higher U.S. prices.</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;75&quot; data-end=&quot;348&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to trade with a bearish tilt after a series of failed upside attempts near key technical levels. The 100-hour moving average (currently near 0.8284) served as strong resistance earlier this week, capping rallies yesterday most recently, and helping to turn buyers into sellers into the day close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;350&quot; data-end=&quot;682&quot;&gt;The recent decline seen today, initially found buyers near the 50% midpoint of the April-to-May range at 0.8257. However, EU tariff news triggered a decisive break below this level, adding downside momentum. The pair did not find support until reaching the next key swing area between 0.8193 and 0.8212—highlighted by past price reaction zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;With price now below both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages and under key Fibonacci retracement levels, the bears remain in control unless buyers can push the pair back above 0.8257 (50%) and then 0.8284 (100 hour MA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;Overall, howver, the technicals are doing their job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;888&quot; data-end=&quot;913&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;916&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8257 (50% retracement), 0.8284 (100-hour MA), 0.8300 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;999&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8212/0.8193 (swing area), 0.8163, 0.8139&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1051&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1053&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.8284, with further downside potential if 0.8193 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Trump took a break from the trade war to go to the Middle East and wouldn&apos;t have wanted to announce something like this during the G7 on Wed/Thurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Trump will attend the G7 in Canada from June 15-17, so if he follows the pattern of lowering tensions during international visits, that leaves a three-week window.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 1.5% shortly before the open while Nasdaq futures are down 1.8% as Apple falls 3.5% on Trump tariff threats on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a long weekend in the US so trade could taper off into the weekend but a big question will be: When to buy the dip? The lesson of the China trade war round is that Trump doesn&apos;t have the appetite to really hurt the stock market, so the trade is to buy the dip. The question is: when?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a much tougher one to answer. We&apos;re at the end of another week and there haven&apos;t been any trade deals this week, despite Hassett saying they were coming again. The July 9 deadline for tariffs is fast approaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, there is no edge in guessing at the timing of when to buy. At best, you can buy it when Trump tells you to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The market is figuring out that it&apos;s better to sell the US dollar in the trade war</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The knee-jerk reaction to Trump threatening tariffs on the EU was to buy the US dollar on a number of fronts but that&apos;s quickly faded. Cable is now trading near the highs, AUD has bounced all the way back and the loonie is at its best levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the euro -- which is the target of the tariffs -- has rebounded 35 pips and is still up a half-cent on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend so far this year has been to sell the US dollar as the US breaks the global consensus on trade. That should be the result of this round of tariffs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, some people will be looking to buy the dip but that&apos;s tough to time. It&apos;s certainly early at the moment but if you believe Trump will ultimately back down then it&apos;s never too early. He left himself an out by waiting until June 1 and it&apos;s notable that there is a call scheduled today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU doesn&apos;t have the backbone for a fight in the way that China does so this could go badly for them if they roll over. That said, it&apos;s tough with so many voices in Europe. If they do fight, it could embolden the Chinese, Japanese and others as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, these are all risks for the US economy and US dollar. I don&apos;t see how the Fed gets any closer to cutting rates now and I don&apos;t see how US businesses will be more-willing to invest or hire in light of this development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the clearest trades are buying the yen, Swiss franc and gold.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies want some consistency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaders have to put pencils down because of so much change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 50% EU tariff is an order of magnitude different from current situation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff rates that high would be scary for the suppl;y chain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is anxiety among firms that continued tariff announcements would disrupt the supply chain and lead to rising price environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the short run the Fed needs to wait for the dust to clear, the bar for action is higher until that happens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If tariffs have a stagflationary impact then that is the central banks worse situation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My fear is the data comes out with a lag, so something may have already happened. Upcoming reports may show a more serious impact from actions already taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market determines the long end of yields. We should take into consideration the impact from that impact on the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our job is to look at anything that affects prices and employment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest rates are still within historical ranges, if there is a crisis over US fiscal stability they would be moving higher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ON April 2, I thought rates could come down by the end of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That might be extended out 10-16 months from now. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still feel that underneath the volatility, the economy remains strong, if tariffs and uncertainty were not a threat to inflation, rates would eventually fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the Fed to do, but wait given the fiscal side of the equation is easing and tightening on a daily basis.  Yes trade policy is 11% of the economy but the impact can be a multiple of that 11% if the apple cart is more than wobbling and it has ancillary impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk managers look to define and limit risk, and then accept risk.  That does not mean not take risk, it just says they define and limit it as much as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Goolsbee and the Fed members are saying is risk to inflation and employment can not be defined. It cannot be limited.  So sit tight until the dust settles.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD is moving to the downside reversing the gains from earlier today after Pres. Trump said he would impose a 50% tariff on EU imports into the US starting June 1.  He also said he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones not manufactured in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb down the mountain restarts(and things seemed so bright in the Middle East last week). Yields are lower. Stocks are sharply lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video above, I take a look at the three major currency pairs - the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD - from a technical perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US yields:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.932%, -6.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.027%, -8.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.473%, -8.0basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 yar yield 4.997%, -6.3  basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US stock indices, the earlier pre-market gains are being eroded fast with the Nasdaq moving from about +40 points to down -92 points over just the last hour of trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow dow -577 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P down -88 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq -390 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The trade war was never going to be one-and-done. Trump loves tariffs too much and has too long of a list of grievances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of progress on trade deals over the past two weeks was a red flag and the 90-day deadline was ticking ever closer. He&apos;s left himself an &apos;out&apos; here by delaying this to June 1 but at the same time, I think he&apos;s handing some leverage to China here in negotiations. How many fronts does the US want to fight at once?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks have been a wonderful, placid moment and a glimpse into what could be, but until Congress takes away Trump&apos;s ability to impose tariffs, then this dance will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK retail sales report was the only highlight. The data beat expectations by a huge margin with good weather cited as the main reason. Nonetheless, there&apos;s been a strong positive trend in retail sales for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the markets, the most notable mover has been the US Dollar which extended the overnight losses. There was no catalyst since yesterday&apos;s strong US PMIs, but the fact that the market has already repriced interest rates expectations in line with the Fed&apos;s baseline for 2025 gives the greenback little support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will need more to trim the rate cuts bets further and give the USD a boost. That could come with the data in June when we get ISM PMIs, NFP and CPI before the FOMC Policy Decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, we could either range here or see more losses for the greenback. For today, we are already at the daily average range limit, so there shouldn&apos;t be much follow through in the American session and chances of a pullback are higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in the session, Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 25% tariffs on Apple if the iPhones were not made in the US. That saw the AAPL stock dropping more than 3% in pre-market trading.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;iPhone&apos;s that will be sold in the US will be manufactured and built in US, not India or anyplace else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If that&apos;s not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAPL stock is down on the news.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 51 bps (95% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 52 bps (94% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 39 bps (94% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 34 bps (70% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 68 bps (57% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 60 bps (90% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 50 bps (81% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;*for the SNB, the rest of the probability is for a 50 bps cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 15 bps (98% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key events that weighed on the market pricing this week were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA&apos;s Bullock mentioning that they did discuss a 50 bps cut. That saw the market increasing the rate cut bets for the RBA from 54 bps to 68 bps by year-end. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canadian Core inflation data surprising to the upside. That caused the market to price out immediately a rate cut in June that was expected before the CPI release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hot UK CPI data. The market took a less dovish view and favoured just one rate cut in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Bulgaria Advances Toward Euro Adoption</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/news/bulgaria-advances-toward-euro-adoption-20250523/</link>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;106&quot;&gt;Investor Update: Bulgaria Advances Toward Euro Adoption – Symbolic but Limited Impact on Euro Currency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;108&quot; data-end=&quot;590&quot;&gt;Core News:
Bulgaria is making steady progress toward adopting the euro by January 1, 2026. The country has met most Maastricht criteria, including public debt limits, fiscal discipline, and exchange rate stability. The main remaining challenge is elevated inflation, while political stability is also seen as critical for ensuring a successful transition. Despite recent debate—including a proposed national referendum—the trajectory remains broadly on course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;592&quot; data-end=&quot;631&quot;&gt;Implications for the Euro Currency:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;633&quot; data-end=&quot;1544&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;633&quot; data-end=&quot;857&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;635&quot; data-end=&quot;857&quot;&gt;Marginal Economic Impact: Bulgaria&apos;s economy is relatively small compared to the broader eurozone. As such, its inclusion is unlikely to significantly shift the euro&apos;s macro fundamentals or valuation in FX markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;859&quot; data-end=&quot;1060&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;861&quot; data-end=&quot;1060&quot;&gt;Already Pegged: Since 1999, the Bulgarian lev has been pegged to the euro via a currency board, meaning the transition to full euro adoption will likely have minimal exchange rate volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1062&quot; data-end=&quot;1321&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1064&quot; data-end=&quot;1321&quot;&gt;Symbolic Significance: Bulgaria&apos;s accession reinforces confidence in the euro project. In an environment where some countries have questioned deeper integration, Bulgaria’s move is a political signal of continued EU cohesion and currency appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1323&quot; data-end=&quot;1544&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1325&quot; data-end=&quot;1544&quot;&gt;Banking System Already Integrated: Bulgaria has participated in the ECB’s banking union and supervision mechanisms for several years. This lowers systemic risk and supports a smoother monetary policy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1546&quot; data-end=&quot;1589&quot;&gt;Potential Risks and Internal Frictions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1590&quot; data-end=&quot;1972&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1590&quot; data-end=&quot;1778&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1592&quot; data-end=&quot;1778&quot;&gt;Catch-Up Inflation: Price level convergence with eurozone averages could trigger a one-time inflationary jump in Bulgaria, a common concern in smaller economies joining the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1779&quot; data-end=&quot;1972&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1781&quot; data-end=&quot;1972&quot;&gt;Implementation Risks: BNB official Iliya Lingorski warned of logistical hurdles, including software upgrades and infrastructure overhauls. These could complicate the rollout timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1974&quot; data-end=&quot;2424&quot;&gt;Investor Takeaway:
Bulgaria’s euro adoption will not materially impact the euro’s strength or stability, but it does offer a symbolic boost to EU integration and policy credibility. For investors, the transition reduces currency risk in Bulgaria, supports long-term capital inflows, and confirms eurozone resilience. However, watch for short-term volatility tied to political developments and inflation dynamics within Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2426&quot; data-end=&quot;2666&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;This article was generated at ForexLive.com (evolving to be investingLive.com at the end of this year)

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;280&quot; data-end=&quot;346&quot;&gt;Gold Futures Analysis for Today with tradeCompass (May 23, 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;348&quot; data-end=&quot;861&quot;&gt;TradeCompass Summary for Gold Futures Traders
As of this analysis, Gold Futures (GC) is trading between $3,325–$3,326. Today’s strategy prioritizes reversal trading setups over breakout momentum plays. That means we expect gold price action to respect its recent range, offering better opportunities for fade trades—long at support and short at resistance. With tradeCompass methodology, we’ll manage risk through clearly defined entry zones, tight stops, and multiple partial profit levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;868&quot; data-end=&quot;927&quot;&gt;Key Levels and Bearish Trade Plan for Gold Futures Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;929&quot; data-end=&quot;1116&quot;&gt;Bearish setups for gold traders today only activate if price reaches $3,344.6 or higher—our preferred reversal zone. This marks a potential exhaustion area where shorts become viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1118&quot; data-end=&quot;1157&quot;&gt;Short Entry Zones for Gold Futures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1489&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1283&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1283&quot;&gt;$3,345.5 – Above our trigger and just before May 19’s Value Area High, which has consistently resisted further upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1284&quot; data-end=&quot;1378&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1286&quot; data-end=&quot;1378&quot;&gt;$3,347.5 – One tick under that VAH level; high-probability entry for aggressive traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1379&quot; data-end=&quot;1489&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1381&quot; data-end=&quot;1489&quot;&gt;$3,350.7–$3,355.5 – Wider resistance zone; if price pushes here, consider scaling in for short exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1491&quot; data-end=&quot;1619&quot;&gt;Protective Stop: A well-placed stop at $3,362.3 keeps risk in check. If breached, gold may accelerate toward $3,400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1621&quot; data-end=&quot;1672&quot;&gt;Partial Profit Targets for Gold Futures Shorts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1674&quot; data-end=&quot;2206&quot;&gt;$3,339.8 – High volume node from yesterday, likely to cause a temporary bounce.
$3,334.6 – Aligned with today’s VAH and yesterday’s VWAP—clustered resistance.
$3,330.2 – Near the round number and May 9 POC—magnetic level for intraday flow.
$3,320.2 – Below recent acceptance zones, likely to act as support.
$3,312.2 – In line with today’s VWAP—technical reaction expected.
$3,302.4 – Lower support and a deeper retracement area.
$3,280.1 &amp;amp; $3,255.0 – Runners for extended bearish moves based on historic profile levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2208&quot; data-end=&quot;2454&quot;&gt;Tip for Gold Futures Traders Using Micros or CFDs: If you&apos;re trading smaller lots, these closely spaced targets give you flexibility. Convert one e-mini into ten micros or segment CFD orders accordingly to maximize precision and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2208&quot; data-end=&quot;2454&quot;&gt;Rebranding Note:
This gold futures analysis is part of the evolving tradeCompass series from ForexLive.com, soon transitioning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investinglive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;investingLive.com&lt;/a&gt;. As we expand beyond forex into commodities, stocks, and crypto, our goal remains the same: delivering actionable, data-driven trading insights to help you navigate today&apos;s markets with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2461&quot; data-end=&quot;2516&quot;&gt;Gold Price Prediction and Long Trade Setup for Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2518&quot; data-end=&quot;2797&quot;&gt;We only look to turn bullish on gold if the price dips to $3,279.8 and reclaims it from below—an approach that filters out false bounces. A tactical confirmation method is to wait for price to sweep below and close back above this level before initiating long trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2799&quot; data-end=&quot;2897&quot;&gt;Stop for Long Trades: Keep it tight around $3,273.0—below this, the bullish premise fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2899&quot; data-end=&quot;2949&quot;&gt;Partial Profit Targets for Gold Futures Longs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2951&quot; data-end=&quot;3406&quot;&gt;$3,293.0 – Below May 22 POC, which may offer first resistance.
$3,300.0 – Round number magnet and visible on many trader dashboards.
$3,306.6 – May 21 VWAP and POC convergence—sticky level.
$3,309.5 – May 22 VWAP—watch for pauses or profit-taking.
$3,316.7 – Just below May 22 VAH—possible stalling area.
$3,329.3 – Near May 19 POC, an important control level.
$3,346.9 – Runner target inside the bearish reversal zone—book final profits here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3408&quot; data-end=&quot;3627&quot;&gt;Note for Gold Price Forecast Traders: When entering below a key level, target exits just beneath it. When entering above, exit just above. This tradeCompass nuance improves execution during volatile intraday swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3634&quot; data-end=&quot;3685&quot;&gt;Reversal Strategy Logic for Gold Futures Traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3687&quot; data-end=&quot;4037&quot;&gt;Gold futures analysis today hinges on the behavior around the edges of the trading range. Instead of chasing moves, tradeCompass favors reversal entries at historically reactive zones like VAH, VWAP, and POC. This method reduces false breakout risk and emphasizes smart trade timing through confirmation and precise partial profit-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4044&quot; data-end=&quot;4098&quot;&gt;Trade Management Reminders for Gold Futures Traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;4100&quot; data-end=&quot;4376&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4100&quot; data-end=&quot;4150&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4102&quot; data-end=&quot;4150&quot;&gt;Stick to one trade per direction per plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4151&quot; data-end=&quot;4222&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4153&quot; data-end=&quot;4222&quot;&gt;Adjust stop-loss after securing first or second partial target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4223&quot; data-end=&quot;4301&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4225&quot; data-end=&quot;4301&quot;&gt;Avoid re-entering in the same direction without a new tradeCompass signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4302&quot; data-end=&quot;4376&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4304&quot; data-end=&quot;4376&quot;&gt;Keep stops tied to the opposite threshold—never random or arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4383&quot; data-end=&quot;4428&quot;&gt;Disclaimer for Gold Price Forecast Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4430&quot; data-end=&quot;4703&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;This gold futures forecast is a decision-support tool, not financial advice. Every trade carries risk, and even high-probability setups can fail due to market events. Stay disciplined, use stops, and only act when setups align with your risk tolerance and trading plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;B2BROKER, a leading
global fintech solutions provider, has announced the launch of Liquidity
Provider Turnkey, a comprehensive solution designed to help financial
institutions seamlessly enter the Prime-of-Prime (PoP) space. The product
arrives at a time when market activity in both forex and digital assets
continues to rise, the financial market becomes more inclusive, and brokers and
other financial market players are searching for new business models, which
will allow them to grow and become successful serving professional clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regulatory standards tighten and technology demands
intensify, the market for ready-made solutions is rapidly expanding. While
turnkey solutions for launching retail brokerages have become relatively
common, there has been no comparable infrastructure for setting up a liquidity
provider business – until recently. B2BROKER’s new offering fills this gap by
delivering the industry’s first fully-integrated, ready-to-deploy solution for
financial companies looking to become institutional liquidity providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, this path has required significant capital
investment — often in the millions — along with deep technical expertise,
robust risk controls, and strong executive oversight. This development will
significantly lower the barrier to entry and eliminate the need to build
infrastructure from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Provider Turnkey enables brokers to launch their
own PoP liquidity business with a suite of institutional-grade features,
including access to over 1,500 trading instruments across 10 asset
classes such as forex, crypto, equities, and commodities. The solution
includes a unified margin account, robust NOP, and deep integration
with key technology providers including PrimeXM, oneZero, Centroid,
FXCubic, and B2CONNECT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built for simplicity and speed, the product removes the
technical and operational barriers traditionally associated with launching a
liquidity provider business. Features include dynamic margining, real-time
balance monitoring, and built-in KYC, all underpinned by 24/7
technical support and compliance consulting for Tier-1 and Tier-2
jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see growing demand from financial companies looking to
move into the institutional liquidity space, and our turnkey solution provides
them with the tools and infrastructure to make that transition successfully,”
said John Murillo, Chief Dealing Officer at B2BROKER. “Our aim is to make
institutional expansion accessible, fast, and scalable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is built for financial institutions seeking a
fast operational launch without building infrastructure from the ground up.
This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       Retail
brokers expanding into institutional markets;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       Proprietary
trading firms looking to internalize liquidity and monetize trading flow;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       Asset
managers and hedge funds leveraging market expertise for liquidity provision;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       IB and
agent networks transitioning to full-service liquidity providers;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       Fintechs
entering the B2B trading infrastructure space;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       Banks
diversifying their business models and revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond core trading infrastructure, Liquidity Provider
Turnkey includes a customizable website, SEO optimization, payment
integrations, and a centralized CRM system for full operational
control. It’s also bundled with B2BROKER’s industry-leading payment technology,
including B2BINPAY and EQWIRE, which support multi-currency accounts, automated
deposit/withdrawal flows, and crypto processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business model enables clients to generate revenue
through spreads, swaps, commissions, and treasury operations, while maintaining
a risk-free LP model. Additional cross-selling opportunities through
B2BROKER’s product ecosystem—such as B2CORE, B2TRADER, and B2COPY—further
enhance monetization and long-term business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Liquidity Provider Turnkey, B2BROKER poses itself as a
market innovator, offering brokers a fast, compliant, and tech-forward path to
becoming institutional liquidity providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About B2BROKER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2BROKER (https://b2broker.com) is a global fintech
solutions provider for financial institutions. It delivers liquidity, trading
technology, payment solutions, and brokerage infrastructure through a network

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;June cut &apos;appropriate&apos; if data confirm stabilisation of inflation, weak growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given the uncertain environment, the ECB should stick to its data-dependent approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next inflation data for the Eurozone should be key but I still think that a cut in June would be taken as a mistake by the market and lead to further rise in long term yields.&lt;/p&gt;

From a tradeCompass perspective, this places Bitcoin in a short-term intraday bearish bias, as price is currently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1633&quot; data-end=&quot;1771&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1633&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1635&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot;&gt;Below today’s VWAP of $111,383&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1672&quot; data-end=&quot;1714&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1674&quot; data-end=&quot;1714&quot;&gt;Below yesterday’s VWAP of $111,157&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1715&quot; data-end=&quot;1771&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1717&quot; data-end=&quot;1771&quot;&gt;Below yesterday’s Value Area Low (VAL) of $110,930&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1773&quot; data-end=&quot;2071&quot;&gt;The confluence of multiple VWAPs and the VAL acting as overhead resistance strengthens the bearish outlook. Until we see a sustained break above $111,800 (the first upper deviation of today’s VWAP), the default plan remains to favor short setups and partial profit-taking at logical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2078&quot; data-end=&quot;2138&quot;&gt;Key Levels and Partial Profit Targets for Bitcoin Futures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2140&quot; data-end=&quot;2189&quot;&gt;Bearish Scenario (Active below $111,383 VWAP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2194&quot; data-end=&quot;2341&quot;&gt;$110,470 – Just above yesterday’s first lower VWAP deviation. Often attracts responsive buyers, making it a smart first scale-out for shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2345&quot; data-end=&quot;2453&quot;&gt;$109,715 – Near the second lower VWAP deviation. A deeper target indicating stronger bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2457&quot; data-end=&quot;2552&quot;&gt;$108,750 – Above May 21st&apos;s Value Area High, likely to draw short-term positioning exits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2556&quot; data-end=&quot;2698&quot;&gt;$106,875 – Just above the Point of Control (POC) from May 21. A natural support zone where profit-taking and buyer defense often emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2702&quot; data-end=&quot;2766&quot;&gt;$106,500 – A major level with multiple-day confluence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;2770&quot; data-end=&quot;2928&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2770&quot; data-end=&quot;2784&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2772&quot; data-end=&quot;2784&quot;&gt;May 21 VAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2788&quot; data-end=&quot;2802&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2790&quot; data-end=&quot;2802&quot;&gt;May 20 POC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2806&quot; data-end=&quot;2820&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2808&quot; data-end=&quot;2820&quot;&gt;May 19 VAH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2824&quot; data-end=&quot;2928&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2826&quot; data-end=&quot;2928&quot;&gt;May 12 VAH

When price trades below VWAP, it often signals institutional selling pressure; above VWAP suggests buyer dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3701&quot; data-end=&quot;3961&quot;&gt;VWAP standard deviations help define dynamic zones of price extension or mean reversion. These bands expand during volatile sessions and contract in consolidation, helping intraday traders determine high-probability reversal or continuation points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;3963&quot; data-end=&quot;4066&quot;&gt;Complementing this, the Volume Profile outlines areas where trading activity was most concentrated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;4068&quot; data-end=&quot;4319&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4068&quot; data-end=&quot;4144&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4070&quot; data-end=&quot;4144&quot;&gt;Value Area High (VAH): Top of the 70% value zone; acts as resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4145&quot; data-end=&quot;4237&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4147&quot; data-end=&quot;4237&quot;&gt;Point of Control (POC): The most actively traded price; often acts as a price magnet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4238&quot; data-end=&quot;4319&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4240&quot; data-end=&quot;4319&quot;&gt;Value Area Low (VAL): Bottom of the value zone; typically acts as support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4321&quot; data-end=&quot;4497&quot;&gt;Understanding where Bitcoin is in relation to these zones allows traders to position around acceptance vs rejection levels, increasing the odds of well-timed entries and exits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4504&quot; data-end=&quot;4570&quot;&gt;tradeCompass Methodology and Risk Management for Bitcoin Futures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4572&quot; data-end=&quot;4796&quot;&gt;The tradeCompass methodology is designed to simplify complex price action into clear directional thresholds and logical partial targets. This minimizes emotional trading and overtrading by enforcing discipline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;4798&quot; data-end=&quot;5336&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4798&quot; data-end=&quot;4918&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4800&quot; data-end=&quot;4918&quot;&gt;Only one trade per direction per day: Once partial targets are hit, wait for a full reset before reversing bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;4919&quot; data-end=&quot;5063&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;4921&quot; data-end=&quot;5063&quot;&gt;Stop-loss placement must respect the compass: Never place a stop beyond the opposite threshold — a breach invalidates the trade premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;5064&quot; data-end=&quot;5228&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5066&quot; data-end=&quot;5228&quot;&gt;Adapt your entry confirmation: Some traders use candle closes above/below thresholds, others wait for a momentum burst. Choose what suits your risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;5229&quot; data-end=&quot;5336&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5231&quot; data-end=&quot;5336&quot;&gt;Move stops after partial exits: Reduce risk exposure while allowing the rest of the trade to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5343&quot; data-end=&quot;5390&quot;&gt;Clarification for Traders Using tradeCompass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5392&quot; data-end=&quot;5551&quot;&gt;This tradeCompass analysis should be read as a navigation map, not a directional prediction. The key is how price behaves near the mapped levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;5553&quot; data-end=&quot;5803&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;5553&quot; data-end=&quot;5684&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5555&quot; data-end=&quot;5684&quot;&gt;If Bitcoin futures stay below VWAP and fail to reclaim it intraday, short setups toward lower partial targets remain valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;5685&quot; data-end=&quot;5803&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5687&quot; data-end=&quot;5803&quot;&gt;If price breaks above $111,800 and holds, that shifts the bias — and bullish targets can be pursued accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5805&quot; data-end=&quot;5915&quot;&gt;The real value lies in reacting to price with a structured plan, not in forecasting with blind conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5922&quot; data-end=&quot;5950&quot;&gt;Disclaimer for Bitcoin Traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;5952&quot; data-end=&quot;6263&quot;&gt;This content is provided as decision-support, not investment advice. Bitcoin futures are volatile instruments and carry significant risk. The tradeCompass system provides a structured framework to define intraday opportunity zones — but outcomes depend on market behavior and personal trade execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;6265&quot; data-end=&quot;6345&quot;&gt;Always trade at your own risk. Stay informed, stay patient, and trade smart.&lt;/p&gt;
