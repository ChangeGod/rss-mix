                            &lt;p&gt;Reminder, on Thursday, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said &quot;I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day&quot; on a tariff deal. We&apos;re still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bessent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trading deals maybe as early as this week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m highly confident that 17 trading partners excluding China have presented with very good trade proposals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could see more frictionless trade from these negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could see substantial progress with China in the coming weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market is not pricing in inflation, hard data is still resilient&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, this would all result in very low tariffs between the US and the world but you have to have a great deal of faith to make that call at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;253&quot; data-end=&quot;558&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD buyers had their opportunity to reclaim control with a move above the  converged 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (at 1.33238), but momentum stalled, and the price has since rotated back lower. The failure to stay above those key MAs has shifted short-term control back to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;560&quot; data-end=&quot;761&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support continues to hold above a familiar swing area between 1.3259 and 1.3273, but that zone remains fragile. A confirmed break and hold below it would strengthen the bearish bias going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;1010&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next downside targets come in at the April 23 low of 1.3232, followed by the swing area near 1.3203. A move through those levels would increase downside pressure and potentially open the door toward the 38.2% retracement at 1.3160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1012&quot; data-end=&quot;1152&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the buyers had their shot, it’s the sellers who are now dictating the pace—provided they can push and hold below the key support band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1172&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3325 (200/100-hour MAs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1223&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1225&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3259–1.3273 (swing area), 1.3232 (April 23 low), 1.3203 (next swing area), 1.3160 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Reporter spoke with a White House spokesman who said that Trump&apos;s talk about tariffs may get walked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/white-house-clarifies-trump-movie-tariff-1236207216/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s initial tweet about it didn&apos;t leave much room for interpretation but the quick climbdown highlights that everything in this administration is made up as they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be the first tariff on a service, which is a dangerous game for the US to play because it has a huge trade surplus in services globally and virtually all of the major US tech companies are services exporters in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;189&quot; data-end=&quot;616&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD attempted to break above its 200-hour moving average at 1.13510 in early U.S. trading, but—just like on Friday—buyers lacked follow-through and momentum quickly faded. The failed breakout attracted fresh selling interest, and the price has since rotated lower, falling back below both the 200-hour and 100-hour moving averages (the latter at 1.13354), shifting short-term control back to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;618&quot; data-end=&quot;974&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next downside target lies at 1.13072, a low from the week before last. A break below that level would open the door toward the key swing area between 1.1271 and 1.12754. Beyond that, the 38.2% retracement of the March–April rally sits at 1.12505—a critical level for buyers to defend if they want to maintain control of the broader uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;976&quot; data-end=&quot;1227&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite buyers struggling to extend gains, sellers also have work to do. Only a firm move below 1.12505 level (the 38.2% retracement) would signal that they are regaining more meaningful control, challenging the buyers from the 843-pip rally from 1.0729 low on March 27 to 1.15726 high on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The evidence is mounting that the US isn&apos;t interested in getting to 0% tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyodo reported about 3 hours ago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;US rejects request for full exemption from reciprocal tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US would consider lowering 14% tariff rate due to resume on July 9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US side stressed that it will only consider extending 10% tariffs or lowering 14% rate depending on progress of talks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m having a hard time seeing how we ever get broad trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tax legislation will prevent main street tax hike by making small business deduction permanent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legislation will restore 100% expensing for equipment, expand full expensing to factory construction, provide tax credits and deductions for R&amp;amp;D&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US markets are &apos;antifragile&apos; over a long-term horizon, it&apos;s never a bad time to invest in America&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some real arrogance in thinking they can re--write the rules of international trade and economics while running deficits at 7% of GDP with no path towards a balanced budget. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a distinct downturn in tech and energy sectors, leading to widespread volatility across the board. The technology sector, notably the consumer electronics and semiconductors segments, displays significant declines, with major players like Apple (AAPL) down by a steep 3.12% and Nvidia (NVDA) dipping 1.14%. Meanwhile, AMD bucks the trend, showing a positive gain of 1.97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the energy sector, leading companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are down 2.57% and 1.68%, respectively, contributing to the overall negative sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market&apos;s mood today is uncertain and bearish, with overarching dips in previously robust sectors. Investor trepidation stems from mixed economic signals and geopolitical tensions affecting resource availability and tech innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical: Amazon (AMZN) struggles, dropping 1.61%, impacted by mixed retail forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Services: Amidst the negativity, Google (GOOG) stays resilient with a 0.46% increase, reflecting sustained confidence in its innovative capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financials: This sector shows some resilience, with Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC) posting moderate gains of 0.53% and 0.52%, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: Stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Lilly (LLY) are slightly up, generally considered safe havens in volatile markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty looms large, urging investors to seek safety and reassess risk tolerance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification remains key: With tech and energy in decline, investors might focus on more stable sectors such as financials and healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on innovation: Google&apos;s resilience suggests that companies with strong R&amp;D and innovative pipelines could be less susceptible to market swings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term opportunities: Use current dips as strategic entry points but prioritize sectors less affected by immediate global challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay updated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for real-time insights and expert analyses, and continue to watch the broader market trends closely in these volatile times. 📊&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;All last week there were reports that the US was close to a deal with India on tariffs and trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Bloomberg is reporting that India offered the USA rates of 0% of auto parts and steel so long as the US did the same. If the US takes that deal it would be very good news for everyone but it&apos;s hard to imagine they well. How is the US going to put 25% tariffs on Canadian steel but not on India? Or maybe everyone who makes a deal ends up with zero tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we will just have to wait for a deal and look at the details. Obviously, there are plenty of recent bets placed on a low-tariff world returning so we will see.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;252&quot; data-end=&quot;515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD is trading with a bullish tilt after bouncing from its 100-hour moving average, which successfully stalled declines both on Friday and earlier today. That MA, currently near 0.5938, acted as a technical floor, helping buyers regain control. The price ultimately moved above its 200 hour moving average at 0.59515 and found more buyers and more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;769&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The upside momentum has pushed price back toward the familiar resistance zone around 0.6000, a key swing area that has capped the pair multiple times over the past two weeks (see red numbered circles). A break above this zone would open the door to more upside potential with the high from April the next obvious target at 0.60281.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;769&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Move above that level and the price is trading at the highest level since November when the price high reached 0.6037. That level is also near the 61.8% retracement of the move down from the 2024 high to the 2025 low.  That little comes in a 0.60364&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;771&quot; data-end=&quot;994&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the bias remains tilted to the upside as long as price holds above the 200-hour MA. A move below it would weaken that bias and shift focus back toward the downside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;996&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1024&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6000 swing area (multi-day ceiling). 0.6028 (high for 2025). 0.6036 – 0.6037 (61.8% retracement and high from November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5951 (200 hour moving average), 0.5939 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

seasonal trends. We seem to be outperforming some of the publicly traded
 restaurants reporting results.” [Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Tariffs are negatively impacting small business customers. Many 
small business customers source their products from China. They cannot 
afford to compete in the marketplace sourcing from other countries. We 
could not move products fast enough to beat the tariff starting dates.” 
[Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp;amp; Hunting]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Business is steady.” [Construction]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“There is great concern at my institution (medical school with a 
research institute and hospital) that changes from the current 
administration will severely and adversely affect many of the 
populations we are trying to help live healthier lives.” [Educational 
Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We are actively reviewing the impact of tariffs. We are seeing some
 vendors increasing their prices, and we are actively pushing back on 
those increases. We expect our vendors to honor our contracted pricing.”
 [Health Care &amp;amp; Social Assistance]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Generally, pricing is lower, but there is some uncertainty of actual, final costs due to tariffs.” [Other Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our business is in a state of crises with uncertainty caused by 
both the ongoing trade war and the threats to federal funding of 
programs.” [Public Administration]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Uncertainty remains the dominating theme as the U.S. government has
 been maddeningly inconsistent with tariff implementation.” [Real 
Estate, Rental &amp;amp; Leasing]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Tariffs and concerns about government grants still impacting our 
procurement operations. Some projects are slowing or being held off to 
ensure we have funds to complete the current work.” [Transportation 
&amp;amp; Warehousing]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The tariff uncertainty is causing a lot of consumption of human 
capital. We are starting to see some tariff charges, some are 
significant given the price of the highly specialized units that were 
ordered over two years ago. Based on our spend over the last couple of 
years, we will have to adjust our capital and operations and maintenance
 plans.” [Utilities]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re seeing some bids in the US dollar in response to this report. USD/JPY is up to 143.90 from 143.66 while the euro has fallen 15 pips.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;136&quot; data-end=&quot;551&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is surging higher today and has convincingly broken above its 200-day moving average at 0.6461—a key technical milestone. On Friday, the pair briefly traded above this level for the first time since November 8, 2024, but bullish momentum faded, and the price settled back into a familiar swing area between 0.6427 and 0.6441. The Friday close landed near the upper end of that zone at 0.6441.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;553&quot; data-end=&quot;804&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In early Asian trading today, the low dipped to 0.64337, within that same swing zone, before buyers stepped back in. The price reclaimed the 200-day MA, briefly pulled back to retest it, then based and pushed to a fresh session high at 0.6493.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;806&quot; data-end=&quot;1074&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the pair now holding above the 200-day MA for a sustained period, 0.6461 becomes a key bias-defining support level. As long as the price remains above, the upside bias stays intact. Sellers gain no technical traction unless price breaks back below that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1076&quot; data-end=&quot;1244&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the daily chart, the next upside target lies at the November 29 swing high of 0.65277, followed by the 61.8% retracement and high from November 25 at 0.6549 (see the chart below).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prelim was 51.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-march-sp-global-final-services-pmi-544-vs-543-prelim-20250403/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Prior &lt;/a&gt;was 54.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 50.6 vs 51.2 prelim and 53.5 prior -- weakest since Sept 2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slower activity growth was linked to similarly weaker gains
in new work during April&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expansion in staffing was &apos;marginal&apos;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rate of inflation eased considerably from
March’s one-and-a-half year high to its weakest of 2025 so far&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, sentiment was at its lowest
level for two-and-a-half years and amongst the weakest since
the height of the pandemic in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P Global
Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;While tariff announcements mean manufacturing dominates
the news, a worrying backstory is developing in the vastly
larger services economy, where business activity and hiring
have come closer to stalling in April amid plunging business
confidence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Business and consumer facing service providers alike, and
especially financial services firms, are reporting markedly
weaker growth prospects, citing intensifying uncertainty over
the economic outlook amid recent tariff announcements and
ongoing federal spending cuts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;A key area of weakness is slumping exports of services, which
is now falling at rate not seen since 2022, but domestic demand
is also reportedly waning as confidence slides lower.
&quot;Higher prices paid for imports due to tariffs are also driving
up service sector firms’ costs, feeding though to higher prices,
notably in consumer-facing industries such as restaurants and
hotels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The resulting bottom line from the services sector is a
heightened risk of stalling growth and rising inflation, or
stagflation.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;In March this index fell to 41.2 from 46.6, which was the lowest reading since June 2020. It bounced slightly here but that&apos;s hardly reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite index 41.7 vs 42.0 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Job losses were recorded for
a fourth successive month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lack of present incoming new work meant firms were
generally willing to let employees leave without replacing
them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firms chose on average to reduce
their selling prices for the first time in nearly four years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panellists reported that sales volumes had continued to
deteriorate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Backlogs of work were nonetheless reduced
markedly again as capacity remained more than sufficient to
deal with current workloads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sure sounds like a recession and that the BOC needs to get ahead of the curve. This report doesn&apos;t get a great deal of attention in the market but maybe it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Smith, Economics Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Canada’s service sector economy faced another
challenging month, with activity declining steeply and
new business volumes again down sharply. Firms again
linked these weak trends to widespread economic and
political uncertainty, in turn linked to trade policies
and, at the time of survey data collection, the general
election.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Service providers are hopeful that a more stable
business environment will have emerged in a year’s
time, but presently, given the lack of new work and
excess capacity at units, job losses were again reported.
Moreover, adding to the woes of service providers,
firms felt compelled to reduce their output charges for
the first time in over four years – despite input price

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;436&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD continues to trade with a bearish tilt as the 100-hour (1.38197) and 200-hour (1.38394) moving averages act as a ceiling for price action. Each of the last three upside attempts has stalled near these levels, reinforcing their role as risk-defining resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;438&quot; data-end=&quot;652&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While lows have edged slightly lower, downside momentum has been limited. Still, the inability to build sustainable upside suggests sellers remain in control, especially while price stays below the moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move above 1.38394 would shift the near-term bias, but until then, rallies remain opportunities for sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taking a broader look at the daily chart, the next key target below the low price from Friday comes in at 1.37415 which represents the 61.8% retracement of the move up from the 2023 low. It is also near swing lows from mid-October before the price started to race into the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another broader look from the daily chart has the back within the up-and-down consolidation range that prevailed from September 2022 until November 2024 (see red box on the chart below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;766&quot; data-end=&quot;781&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;782&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;782&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;784&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance (risk/bias-defining): 1.38197 (100-hour MA), 1.38394 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;868&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3781 (low from April 14), 1.37698 (low from April 30), 1.37593 (low from May 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Investor Alert: 100% Tariff on Foreign Movies Announced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump has announced intentions to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced abroad entering the United States. Trump cited significant incentives offered by other countries to attract American filmmakers and studios, describing this as a threat to national security and domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative have been instructed to initiate this tariff process immediately. This development could significantly impact entertainment industry economics, international trade relations, and stock valuations within media and film production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor companies heavily involved in international film production and distribution, as they could face increased costs and potential revenue disruption if such tariffs come into effect. Conversely, purely domestic studios and content producers might see relative benefits from reduced foreign competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Following the announcement by former President Donald Trump regarding a proposed 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies entering the United States, significant industry concerns have emerged around implementation specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key questions being raised include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will movies partially produced overseas, including those with some filming or post-production activities abroad, fall under this tariff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are television series and streaming content, notably productions from major international operations like Netflix, subject to these tariffs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The context behind this tariff originates from recent discussions at Mar-a-Lago involving actors Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson, aiming to address the decline in U.S. entertainment industry employment. Initially, the discussions centered around enhancing federal tax incentives for domestic film production. The tariff proposal appears to be an escalation, potentially designed to aggressively redirect production back to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should anticipate significant scrutiny and debate over the tariff’s specifics, and closely monitor responses from major media and streaming companies with significant international footprints. The policy could potentially reshape competitive dynamics within the entertainment sector, impacting both domestic and global media markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for further updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should you buy the dip later at NFLX stock?

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;264&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to struggle with upside momentum after repeated failures near key technical resistance levels last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;266&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last week, the pair attempted to break above the high extreme at 0.8333 and move toward the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.83505, but sellers held firm. That resistance zone has capped gains on multiple occasions, as shown by the numbered rejections on the chart (see red numbered circles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;266&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having said that, the move lower on Friday also held the support against key swing area between 0.8195 and 0.8212 before rebounding toward the new convergences of 100 and 200 hour moving averages currently at 0.8257 and 0.8263 (blue and green lines on the chart above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;558&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier today, USDCHF briefly traded above its 100-hour (blue) and 200-hour (green) moving averages, but bullish momentum quickly faded. The pair has since rotated back lower and now trades below both moving averages, signaling a more bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;825&quot; data-end=&quot;1187&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair also sits in the lower half of its recent consolidation range, underscoring the bearish tilt in the near term. The inability to sustain gains above the moving averages keeps sellers in control, with focus now on the support zone near 0.8195–0.8212. A break below this area could open the door toward the next swing area and lows from late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1189&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1281&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1217&quot; data-end=&quot;1281&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8257 (100 hour moving average), 0.82636 (200 hour moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1334&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1336&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8195-0.8212 (swing area support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, unless you&apos;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-announces-more-tariffs-plans-100-tariff-on-all-movies-produced-overseas-20250504/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;part of the foreign film industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar is sliding today as we&apos;re reminded that the Commander in Chief is making it up as he goes along. EUR/USD is at he best levels of the day, up 60 pips to 1.1355 while USD/JPY edges below Friday&apos;s low and is down 117 pips to 143.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks look set to end a 9-day winning streak with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures down 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main item on the agenda is the 10 am ET release of the ISM services report for April. This one should capture the mood after tariffs but given that the manufacturing numbers held up ok and all indications are that services spending is fine, the stakes here are fairly low. The consensus is 50.2, down from 50.8 previously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/the-usd-is-lower-to-kickstart-the-new-trading-daya-technical-review-of-the-3-major-pairs-20250505/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is lower to kickstart the new trading day. US stocks are lower. Yields are lower as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;83&quot; data-end=&quot;645&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;EURUSD:
Last week, the EURUSD fell below key daily support between 1.1271 and 1.12754, but the April 15 low at 1.12657 provided a firm floor, preventing further downside. The pair rebounded, and Friday&apos;s price action confirmed support held. In today’s trading, we&apos;ve seen a continuation of that bounce, with the pair moving higher from Friday’s close toward the 100-hour moving average at 1.1336 and the 200-hour moving average at 1.13515. A break above these levels would tilt the bias more bullishly, while holding below keeps sellers in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;647&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;USDJPY:
On Friday, USDJPY moved higher to test the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, where momentum stalled. The pair then rotated lower but recovered into the midpoint of the day’s trading range by the weekly close. In today&apos;s session, the downside rotation has resumed, and the pair is now testing its rising 100-hour moving average at 143.83. This level is the key short-term barometer. A move below would be more bearish and shift focus to the 200-hour moving average at 143.37. Holding above, however, keeps buyers in play with potential for a move back toward the 144.50 area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;647&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;GBPUSD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;647&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD is trading near the high for the day with the 100/200 hour MAs being tested at 1.33249.  The price is testing that level to start the US session for the week. Move above would be a more bullish tilt after holding those MAs on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;647&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A snapshot of the US stock market to start the new trading day is showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industial average -275 points. On Friday the index rose 564.47 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -48 points. Last Friday the index rose 82.53 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -212 points. Last Friday the index rose 266.99 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market yields are mostly lower:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.795%, -4.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield 3.895%, -3.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.306% -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.802%, +0.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This comment shows why it&apos;s so hard to make a deal. It&apos;s so tough for Iran to trust that the US isn&apos;t trying to disarm them as a first step towards regime change. But the US can&apos;t trust Iran because it&apos;s building a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what happens probably comes down to one person -- Trump -- and his willingness to believe Iran or his willingness to go to war.&lt;/p&gt;

Trade headlines continue to be the main thing to watch out for but later in the week, we&apos;ll also have the Fed policy decision in focus. Or should I say, Trump&apos;s reaction to the Fed keeping interest rates on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is once again on the weaker side, with a surge in the Taiwanese dollar earlier in the day sparking speculation of revaluation among currencies against the greenback. Still, the dollar struggled against the majors with USD/JPY slipping back under 144.00 and EUR/USD keeping around 1.1340 currently - up 0.4% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In terms of data, we had Swiss inflation which missed on estimates. Headline annual inflation touched 0% for the first time since March 2021. And that is starting to put the focus back on deflation in Switzerland, which is likely to see negative rates return by the SNB to try and counteract that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, there wasn&apos;t too much else as we continue to wait on how trade talks are going between the US and the rest of the world. Coming up later this week, Vietnam will be meeting with US officials to discuss their terms. So, look out for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the equities space, European indices aren&apos;t doing all too much amid a more mixed mood. But US futures are down, though it comes after a nine-day win streak. It is arguably just a breather as it is already a rarity to see nine straight days of gains, let alone ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is once again lighting up in a push above $3,300 while oil is pressured as OPEC+ seeks to boost output further and that saw prices open with a gap down by over 3% earlier before paring some of that losses.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve ever wondered why I publish the interest rates expectations for major central banks so regularly, then this article will clear things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main thing driving market prices is expectations. The market&apos;s ebb and flow is guided by the pricing and repricing of future expectations. This doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s always right, in fact, there are times when it&apos;s wrong, and those times offer trading opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions change, and when they change the market readjusts its expectations which is then reflected in asset prices. That&apos;s why you should never trade the present because the present is already in the price. It&apos;s what the market has priced in the prior days, weeks or months depending on the underlying reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the underlying expectations is critical for trading success. If you have a good understanding of what&apos;s already expected by the market, you can not only spot the changes and make money, but you can also avoid trading what&apos;s already priced in and preserve your capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had some great examples in April. Before the &quot;Liberation Day&quot;, the market was expecting around 50% tariffs for China and 10% reciprocal tariffs for all the other countries. When Trump announced much higher than expected tariffs, the market started to price in potential retaliations, a global slowdown and even a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By April 9 those were the underlying expectations, but they changed once again when Trump announced the pause for negotiations. From that point onward, the market started to price in de-escalation and price out the negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market didn&apos;t care much about the economic data not only because it was old news by then, but also because it didn&apos;t have the power to change expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you know what&apos;s priced in, then you should focus on what new developments could trigger a change in those expectations. That change will drive prices and you will be able to capitalise on it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold pushes back above $3,300 on the day</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;You can&apos;t keep the gold bugs down for too long it would seem. The drop last week was a testing one but the 50.0 Fib retracement level held, at least on the daily chart as seen above. That is leading to a solid rebound this week with price now looking for a firm run back above the $3,300 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The jump takes out both the 100 and 200-hour moving averages at $3,270 and $3,294 respectively as well. That shifts the near-term bias to being more bullish again currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the bigger picture, the same drivers that have led to gold&apos;s surge in March and April are all still playing out. There&apos;s still some reservations on how Trump&apos;s tariff plans are going to play out and US-China relations continue to be one that doesn&apos;t look like it will be resolved soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;On the latter, there is hopeful optimism that tariff levels will be reduced to around 50% to 60%. Sure, that&apos;s an improvement to the current situation. But it begs the question, doesn&apos;t this all just mean that tariffs are here to stay? And if so, the long-term negative impact is something that broader markets will have to consider - which I believe we are nowhere near considering as of now.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 80 bps (99% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 60 bps (95% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 90 bps (97% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 45 bps (57% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 108 bps (98% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 72 bps (69% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 37 bps (96% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 8 bps (98% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that compared to last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-sees-more-fed-rate-cuts-after-the-weak-us-gdp-but-it-could-be-wrong-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Thursday&apos;s update&lt;/a&gt;, the market trimmed the easing bets for the Fed as a resilient labour market gives the central bank a reason to keep interest rates steady as they await more developments on the tariff side. A rate cut in June has now less than 50% chances as the market sees a rate cut in July as most likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 80 bps priced in by year-end could see further adjustment as the Fed on Wednesday is likely to reiterate that two rate cuts remain the base case unless the labour market weakens meaningfully. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Leading CFD Broker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.easymarkets.com/au/?utm_source=forexlive&amp;amp;utm_medium=press+release&amp;amp;utm_content=easymarkets+homepage&amp;amp;utm_campaign=q1+trading+trends+and+triumphs+article+2025&amp;amp;utm_ef_channel=push&amp;amp;gid=6601483&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;easyMarkets&lt;/a&gt;,
released its Q1 2025 market recap, revealing key trends in global trading
behaviours and highlighting significant developments across various
sectors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
Gold, Nasdaq, and EURUSD remain the top
assets for the third consecutive quarter, with gold reaching near-record
highs, closing in on $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
The crypto market saw a decline in Q1 2025
after strong momentum in 2024, as regulatory expectations for the crypto sector
were not met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
European indices surged, driven by
increased defence spending amidst rising geopolitical tensions, attracting
attention from traders seeking new opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
The Asia Pacific region saw a marked
increase in trading volumes, with local traders actively shaping global trends
in traditional assets and global indices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform upgrades and risk management shifts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;easyMarkets launched key upgrades to its web and mobile
platform, enhancing the overall user experience. In addition, the company
observed a slight decline in the use of Guaranteed Stop Loss orders, indicating
that traders are adjusting their risk management strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikos Antoniades, CEO of easyMarkets, commented: “Our
clients’ shift from crypto to European indices highlights how quickly they are
adapting to macroeconomic developments. At easyMarkets, we are committed to
providing the tools and stability traders need to stay agile in a fast-moving
market.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As global geopolitical tensions and U.S. political
developments continue to shape market sentiment, easyMarkets is confident that
its clients will continue to capitalise on new opportunities in Q2 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on easyMarkets&apos; Q1 2025 performance and

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;They are part of the six countries that the US had shortlisted to be a priority for trade negotiations. So, yeah. The first round of talks is expected on 7 May. For some context, the other countries on that list are India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and the UK. So, let&apos;s see how things go later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
