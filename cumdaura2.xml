                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the main highlight is the Spanish Flash CPI although it shouldn&apos;t change anything for the ECB which is expected to cut again in June. Unless we get some resolution on the trade war, it&apos;s unlikely that the central bank will be swayed from cutting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we get the US Job Openings data and the US Consumer Confidence report. The data in general is not the market&apos;s focus at the moment because it&apos;s already expected to show weakness. As long as the labour market remains resilient, the market is likely to continue to focus on the tariffs related news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, today we have the US Treasury Secretary Bessent joining a White House Press Briefing at 12:30 GMT/08:30 ET and the US Secretary of Commerce Lutnick speaking on CNBC at 18:00 GMT/14:00 ET. These two are the main events of the day and the market will be focused on updates and details on the first trade deal which is said to be announced &apos;this week or the next&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior -24.5; revised to -24.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s a decent improvement but GfK warns that tariffs uncertainty is still very much weighing on the broader outlook. So, that will be a bigger factor to consider in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;No time to rest on his laurels. He will be under a lot of scrutiny to see how he handles the ongoing situation with the US. That especially after getting Trump, or should I say the anti-Trump rhetoric, helped to turn their fortunes around. So, first thing&apos;s first Carney is saying that he will be sitting down with Trump to discuss future economic and security ties between the two sovereign nations. A bit of emphasis on the ending there.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There aren&apos;t any major expiries to take note of on the day. As such, trading sentiment will continue to be driven by the same factors over the last two weeks. That being the overall risk mood and potential headline risks. For today though, the loonie is also going to face risks from the Canadian election. Mark Carney&apos;s Liberal Party has won the election but the question now is whether if he will form a majority or minority government. Adam had this from earlier: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/there-is-one-canadian-election-outcome-that-could-hurt-the-loonie-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;There is one Canadian election outcome that could hurt the loonie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, we shouldn&apos;t see the expiries board above factor into play in the session ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As
I post projections show that Mark Carney’s Liberal Party has won
the election, but its tight. As I post the question it appears if Carney does win he&apos;ll govern as leader of a minority government.  is if Carney will govern in a
majority or minority government. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Canadian dollar rose on the early projections of a Carney win. More broadly, EUR, AUD,
NZD and GBP popped a little higher alongside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;As
counting progressed it became more likely that Carney would govern in
a minority. if he wins. CAD slid away after this, other FX along for the rise too
with a lower EUR, AUD, NZD, GBP alongside. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;News
and data flow otherwise has been light. Of most note, news broke that
Trump is expected to soften
the impact of his automotive tariffs, preventing duties on
foreign-made cars from stacking on top of other tariffs he has
imposed and easing some levies on foreign parts used to manufacture
cars in the U.S. He’s
expected to confirm this on Tuesday (US time) on a trip top Detroit. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
equity index futures reopened for evening trade (US time) with a gap
lower but on this latest Trump reversal have gained. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;As
a bonus news item for UK readers (good morning!) … The UK and the
EU are set to sign a formal declaration committing to “free and
open trade” in defiance of Donald Trump’s tariff agenda. A leaked
draft seen by POLITICO promises a “new strategic partnership”
between London and Brussels. Bye-bye Brexit?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Adam posted this prior to the election, and it looks like its coming to fruition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The outcome I believe that could offer some downside in the loonie (in the 50-120 pip range) is a Liberal minority held up by the NDP. That would essentially extend the current status quo and leaves the Liberals at the mercy of the left-leaning NDP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link here for more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/there-is-one-canadian-election-outcome-that-could-hurt-the-loonie-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;There is one Canadian election outcome that could hurt the loonie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAD sliding further:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Around 2.2% of China&apos;s GDP is directly impacted by U.S. tariffs, according to a note from Nomura economists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They estimate that the U.S. accounted for 14.7% of China&apos;s total goods exports in 2024, a figure that rises to 15.2% when including re-exports through Hong Kong, and to 20.6% when factoring in rerouted trade flows. After accounting for exemptions — with about 16.3% of exports not subject to reciprocal tariffs — the economists calculate that tariffs are directly hitting 2.2% of China’s GDP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also warn that the true economic impact could be larger, as the shock spills over into other areas, particularly the services sectors that support merchandise exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-trump-tariffs-could-endanger-16-million-export-jobs-in-china-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs says Trump tariffs could endanger 16 million export jobs in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I posted comments earlier from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/chinas-fm-says-concession-and-retreat-will-only-make-the-bully-more-aggressive-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;China&apos;s FM says concession and retreat will only make the bully more aggressive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;211&quot; data-end=&quot;623&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;More now on Yi urging BRICS nations to resist U.S. tariff pressure, warns against appeasement. Speaking at a BRICS meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged emerging-market countries to stand firm against U.S. tariff threats, warning that giving in would only embolden Washington. His comments underscored China’s firm stance against entering trade negotiations under pressure, even as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent floated the possibility of banning certain exports to China to gain leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;625&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wang sharply criticized U.S. trade tactics, stating, “The U.S., which has long benefited enormously from free trade, is now going so far as to use tariffs as a bargaining chip to demand exorbitant prices from all countries.” He warned that appeasement would backfire, adding, “If one chooses to remain silent, compromise and cower, it will only make the bully want to push his luck more.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is the fourth consecutive win for the Liberals in Canada. The Conservatives were well ahead until Trump began his attacks on Canada (back in January, Polymarket had odds of the Liberals winning at an &apos;its over&apos; of just 3% ... what a come back!). He has a talent as a wrecking ball.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Results on the east coast of Canada were weaker for the governing Liberal party and Mark Carney but the numbers began rolling in for vote-rich Ontario and Quebec in the last 30 minutes and there has been a shift in fortunes. The Liberals are doing particularly well in Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect some volatility in these numbers over the next hour as it becomes more clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, CAD is doing almost nothing on these numbers, which highlights how low the market thinks the stakes are.&lt;/p&gt;

One insurer with a longer liability profile is also considering investments in the 40-year sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Since then, Barclays says prospects of trade agreements between the U.S. and China, low corporate bonds supply, and better-than-expected corporate earnings have brought them back in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, risks remain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;related to tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We remain cautious and still expect spreads to be wider in the next six months&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs note from Sudnay ICYMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
US tariffs on Chinese imports could put as many as 16 million jobs at
risk in China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If high US-China
tariffs were to persist and Chinese exports were to fall
precipitously, labour markets would surely feel the pressure”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the 16
million jobs would be involved in the production of exports to the US
and nearly one-quarter would be in the wholesale and retail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goldman Sachs says communication equipment, apparel and chemical products “more
vulnerable” than other manufactured goods thanks to their “high
