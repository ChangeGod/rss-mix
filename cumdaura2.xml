 producer prices in April 2025. By contrast, non-durable and durable 
consumer goods, capital goods and intermediate goods were more expensive
 than in the same month of the previous year. When energy prices are 
excluded, producer prices in April 2025 were up 1.5% on April 2024 and 
increased by 0.4% compared with March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did discuss 25 bps or 50 bps cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s more uncertainty than usual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We would expect consumption to pick up amid rate cuts and falling inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far so good on inflation and jobs balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market path for rates reflect risk of really bad global outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not know if there will be long series of cuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cannot say where the cash rate will end up, does not endorse market pricing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are data driven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was an argument for 50 bps, but it was not the strongest argument in the room.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were blown out of the water by the scope of US tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment on the 50 bps is of course what pushed the AUD much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The AUD falls on more dovish RBA forecasts</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The AUD is lower across the board following the RBA decision. The statement was basically the same of what we&apos;ve got in April although there&apos;s more emphasis on trade policies risk. What weighed on the Aussie dollar was the negative revision in growth and inflation forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 2.0% in June 2025, 2.3% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.7% in June 2025, 2.7% in June 2026 and 2.7% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is no big deal because forecasts can change and the central banks have no conviction on what&apos;s next for policy and so on. My expectation is that we will have a rebound in growth and that would place upward pressure on inflation considering the recent rate cuts and fiscal boosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would expect the central banks, including the RBA to deliver less rate cuts than currently priced in. So I would fade this reaction in the AUD, especially versus other currencies because I&apos;m still a bit bullish on the USD until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a nice support zone around the 0.6350 level on AUDUSD. Of course the pair is 80% driven by the USD, so the US macro factors are more influential, but if the sellers manage to extend the pullback, the support zone could be a nice spot where the buyers can look for dip buying opportunities. A break lower though, should open the door for the 0.60 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data on inflation for the March quarter
						provided further evidence that inflation continues to ease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staff forecasts released today project that
						while headline inflation is likely to rise over the coming year to around the top of the band as
						temporary factors unwind, underlying inflation is now expected to be around the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range throughout much of the forecast period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While recent announcements on tariffs have resulted in a rebound in
						financial market prices, there is still considerable uncertainty about the final scope of the tariffs and
						policy responses in other countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These
						developments are expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World trade policy is
						changing rapidly, thereby making the central forecasts subject to considerable uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private domestic demand appears to have been recovering, real
						household incomes have picked up and there has been an easing in some measures of financial stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A range of indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain tight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
						domestic and international developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board judged that the risks to inflation have become more balanced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation is in the target band
						and upside risks appear to have diminished as international developments are expected to weigh on the
						economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With inflation expected to remain around target, the Board therefore judged that an easing in
						monetary policy at this meeting was appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board assesses that this move will make monetary
						policy somewhat less restrictive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board considered a severe
						downside scenario and noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international
						developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
						doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
						in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, this is what I anticipated in the &quot;heads up&quot; article. The RBA lowered the cash rate as an acknowledgement of inflation progress but remains cautious on the future outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank emphasised the risks around trade policies though and the potential drag on growth. That&apos;s why it has cut growth and inflation forecasts, which is what is weighing on the AUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP Growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unemployment seen at 4.2% in June 2025, 4.3% in June 2026 and 4.3% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cash rate assumed at 4.0% in June 2025, 3.2% in June 2026 and 3.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2025/mr-25-13.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its cash rate target by 25 bps bringing it to 3.85% vs 4.10% prior. Focus will be on macro forecasts and forward guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the RBA will keep its neutral stance as it lowers the cash rate just as acknowledgement of inflation progress and as an &quot;insurance&quot; for some potential slowdown given the recent economic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Opposition coalition splits. Nationals withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Party leader Littleproud:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ending coalition with the Liberal Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Party will sit alone on a principled basis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will work constructively with the Liberal Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post for the locals here in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those not in Australia, the Nationals and Liberals have been in coalition for almost forever. Also, the &apos;Liberals&apos; here in Australia are the Conservative side of politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia is currently governed by the Labor Party, the non-conservative side of politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all a simplification. But if you want more politics detail I&apos;m not your man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L to R: Prime Minister Albanese (Labor) and Dutton. Dutton was leader of the losing Liberal Party. Dutton lost his seat in parliament and his Liberal Party suffered a huge defeat. Coalition Nationals did not fare as badly, its little wonder they&apos;ve pulled the pin on the partnership. My tip is they&apos;ll join forces soon enough once the Liberals get their act together under the new leader. &lt;/p&gt;

The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous close was 7.2155&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBOC injected 357bn yuan via 7-day reverse repos at 1.40%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;180bn yuan matured today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;net injection 177bn yuan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>PBOC cuts Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) by 10bp for both 1- and 5-year loans</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The cuts were expected.  The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said that 10 basis point cut would lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivered today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPRs are no longer as important as they once were. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC) shifted its primary monetary policy tool to the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) rate. This transition began in mid-2024. This move aligns China&apos;s monetary policy framework more closely with global standards, such as those of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which typically rely on a single short-term policy rate to guide market expectations and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Japan economy minister Akazawa: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan, U.S. conducted working-level talks on bilateral trade in Washington DC on Monday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no change to Tokyo&apos;s stance of demanding an elimination of U.S. tariffs in bilateral trade negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;schedule for a third round of ministerial-level negotiations was yet to be fixed

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned yesterday that the election in Japan in July is going to be an issue for trade talks. Adam followed up on this Monday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/more-signs-that-the-us-japan-trade-agreement-is-on-ice-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;More signs that the US-Japan trade agreement is on ice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ps.

                            &lt;p&gt;Chinese state banks are cutting deposit rates today as previewed earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-chinas-state-banks-are-expected-to-cut-deposit-rates-today-tuesday-china-time-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;ICYMI - China&apos;s state banks are expected to cut deposit rates today (Tuesday China time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we&apos;ve had cuts announced from China Merchants Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More now, from Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Postal Savings Bank of China. All cutting yuan deposit rates. Chinese banks are under pressure to support economic growth amid a property crisis, weak loan demand and record low interest margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts are on time deposits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; by 5 bps to 0.05%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cuts on one-year time deposits by 15 bps to 0.95%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 bp cuts on three- and five- year time deposits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts are part of stimulus efforts from China. The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said a 10 basis point cut will lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.The monthly LPR fixing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/economic-calendar-in-asia-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cut-expected-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;due at 0100 GMT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPR cuts should help banks lower their funding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese state banks are cutting deposit rates today as previewed earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-chinas-state-banks-are-expected-to-cut-deposit-rates-today-tuesday-china-time-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ICYMI - China&apos;s state banks are expected to cut deposit rates today (Tuesday China time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we&apos;ve had cuts announced from China Merchants Bank,

                            &lt;p&gt;A 25bp cash rate cut is almost unanimously expected. The latest set of forecasts I have seen have all analysts look for 25bp but two, who are looking for a 50bp rate cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m on the 25bp, 50 seems a little extreme for a usually very timid RBA. Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/75bp-of-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cuts-to-come-reuters-poll-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;75bp of Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts to come (Reuters poll)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;175&quot; data-end=&quot;436&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In its note, TD Securities expects the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to deliver a widely anticipated 25 basis point rate cut at today’s policy meeting, bringing the cash rate to 3.85%. The forecast aligns with market consensus and fully priced expectations in OIS markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;438&quot; data-end=&quot;613&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The bank notes that recent inflation and labour market data have broadly matched the RBA’s February projections, providing sufficient grounds to shift toward an easing stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;615&quot; data-end=&quot;854&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While attention will centre on the rate decision, TD says the RBA’s commentary on global tariff risks will be key. “We see risks of minor downgrades to GDP forecasts,” analysts wrote, “but doubt that CPI projections will shift materially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets will be closely watching the RBA&apos;s forward guidance for signals on whether this marks the start of a broader easing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bolding above is mine. I don&apos;t expect too much in the way of promises of future cuts, but the RBA will leave the door open, data dependent etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Bullock&apos;s news conference will follow an hour after the Statement. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;177&quot; data-end=&quot;356&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;UBS is advising investors to maintain a full strategic allocation to U.S. equities, even after the recent market rally and Friday’s U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody’s to Aa1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;358&quot; data-end=&quot;541&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a note published Monday, the bank clarified that its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/stock-market-update/ubs-downgrades-us-equities-to-neutral-but-12-month-view-is-for-higher-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;recent downgrade of U.S. equities&lt;/a&gt; from “Attractive” to “Neutral” reflects short-term valuation concerns, not a bearish outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;543&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We continue to recommend a full strategic allocation,” UBS wrote. “Earnings season highlighted the resilience of structural AI trends, and we expect U.S. stocks to move higher over the next 12 months.” The bank remains overweight on communications services, information technology, health care, and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;543&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I would have thought neutral would mean less than a full allocation. Maintaining &quot;full strategic allocation&quot; despite trimming its outlook seems convoluted reasoning to me. But, hey, maybe that&apos;s why they get paid the big $$$?&lt;/p&gt;
