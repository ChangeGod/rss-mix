    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 56 bps (79% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 42 bps (54% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)

    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 35 bps (89% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 13 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/what-are-the-interest-rate-expectations-for-the-major-central-banks-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Wednesday&apos;s update&lt;/a&gt;, the market is repricing expectations on a more hawkish side across the board. This is because the certainty around the 10% global rate has increased after the US-UK trade deal and it&apos;s also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/federal-reserve-governor-wallers-strategy-for-dealing-with-tariffs-20250415/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;&quot;more hawkish&quot; scenario&lt;/a&gt; for the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have now reached the peak in the &quot;de-escalation trade&quot; and the focus will likely switch to the language from other countries, especially the EU. Will they take a harder stance and oppose categorically the 10% floor? &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India reportedly offers to cut tariffs gap by two-thirds to seal trade deal with the US</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is being reported that India is offering to slash its tariffs gap with the US to below 4% (currently 13%) in exchange for an exemption to Trump&apos;s tariffs. To achieve that, India is said to be offering to reduce duties to zero on 60% of tariff lines in the first phase of the deal. This will help to reduce the average tariff differential between the two countries by about 9% in favour of the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For some context, India was slapped with an initial 26% tariffs before the 90-day pause as they run a large trade surplus of $45.7 billion with the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;One of the sources also add that India has offered preferential access to almost 90% of goods imported from the US, including the reduced tariffs. And considering where they are in talks, India and Japan are the next two countries in line to finalise a deal. The source says that &quot;we will see which one crosses the line first&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;m not sure being able to brag about getting a deal that quickly is all that is cracked up to be in this circumstance. It&apos;s more important to be getting the right deal. And what this says essentially is that India is asking for a full tariffs exemption while offering a host of concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;ll see how that works since Trump and Lutnick have both said that 10% tariffs are &quot;the best&quot; one can get. It&apos;s amazing how at the end of this all, Trump has hoodwinked the world into accepting 10% blanket tariffs across the board as being a good thing. Talk about Stockholm syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our commitment to the 2% inflation target is unwavering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is good we have a diversity of views on MPC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will use scenarios as vehicles for exploring risks around the baseline and accomodating differences of views on the committee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest choice of BoE scenarios does not mean inflation risk skewed in one direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are on course to put inflation surge firmly behind us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global economic environment is likely to continue to be challenging and less predictable that it was in the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK-US trade deal will leave effective tariff rate higher than where they started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK-US Trade Deal &apos;Good News&apos;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic impact of tariffs on UK depends a lot on what rest of the world agrees with the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are putting quite a bit of weight on forward-looking survey evidence showing easing wage inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the BoE cut the bank rate by 25 bps as expected yesterday with a &quot;more hawkish&quot; vote split as two members, including BoE&apos;s Mann, voted for no change. The market now sees a less dovish path for the central bank with 56 bps of easing priced in by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

Will they take a more hawkish stance?&lt;/p&gt;

As a reminder, Biden blocked the deal as one of his final acts as president. And in his most recent comments last month, Trump said that &quot;we don&apos;t want to see it go to Japan&quot;. So, there&apos;s that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We might have reached the peak in the de-escalation trade</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;If this trade deal with the UK was announced two or three weeks ago, I would have said that it&apos;s really good for the markets and would have been very upbeat on risk sentiment. The context is a bit different now, in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall back in the middle of April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/federal-reserve-governor-wallers-strategy-for-dealing-with-tariffs-20250415/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Fed&apos;s Waller&lt;/a&gt; outlined his strategy to deal with tariffs. He had two scenarios in mind: tariffs around 25% on average and tariffs around 10%. The second scenario is the one that is playing out and it involves the Fed being less inclined to cut rates faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the market is taking this first trade deal as the more hawkish scenario for the Fed and the pricing is converging towards the original Fed&apos;s baseline of two rate cuts in 2025 (the pricing is now showing 68 bps by year-end compared to 80 bps at the start of the week). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that with new information throughout the weeks, the 10% has become a &quot;meh&quot; outcome. After April 9 pause, the market rallied on expectations that eventually the US would have gone for 10% reciprocal tariffs and would have lowered the tariffs on China back to the original 50-60% rate. This is what the whole &quot;de-escalation trade&quot; was based on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have now reached the peak in this trade because the US said that the 10% will be the floor for all other deals and we got a report from New York Post yesterday saying that the US is considering lowering the tariffs on China to 50-54%. Recall, the market was expecting 10% global tariffs and 50% on China before the April 2 surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this should now be priced in and the market&apos;s reaction to the news of the US lowering tariffs on China could be a hint. In fact, you would have expected a strong rally, but the market actually went in the opposite way. Nonetheless, this has opened up for a weekend risk scenario in which the market opens up with a positive gap next week, so the selling pressure into the weekend could be limited (I mean it doesn&apos;t look good from a risk management perspective for the bears).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what makes this first trade deal a &quot;meh&quot; outcome is that not only we have some overstretched positioning but we also have the risk of retaliation now. The EU has been repeating that they won&apos;t accept the 10% tariff rate and has been threatening a retaliation in case negotiations fail. But the US is saying that 10% is the best anyone can get and tariffs could be even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week will be the tell. If we open up with a positive gap and the stock market then performs badly throughout the week, then it could be a signal that we have indeed reached the peak (at least in the short term). I would expect the bears to seize the opportunity and start selling at the start of the week. You either catch the top or you get it wrong, but from a risk/reward perspective it doesn&apos;t look bad at all. &lt;/p&gt;

His mentions of &quot;better go out and buy stocks now&quot; and &quot;the stock market will really rally now&quot; were what got the animal spirits pumped up.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD got a boost across
the board yesterday on positive expectations about the first trade deal that
eventually was revealed to be with the UK. Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-reached-breakthrough-deal-with-uk-20250508/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
that tariffs on cars and steel will be lowered but the most important part was
that the 10% “global tariff” will remain in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US officials
highlighted that the 10% is going to be the floor and the trade deal with the
UK is going to be the baseline for all other deals. There’s a risk now that we
reached the peak in de-escalation and other countries might not like the 10%
floor, especially the EU. For now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/federal-reserve-governor-wallers-strategy-for-dealing-with-tariffs-20250415/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve Governor Waller’s scenario&lt;/a&gt;
#2 is playing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall, that he said 10% or
lower tariffs would make him less inclined to cut rates faster. This is now triggering
a repricing in interest rates as the market scaled back the easing expectations
to 68 bps by year-end. We were at more than 80 bps at the start of the week. It
gave also the greenback a boost as the market unwound the crowded dollar
shorts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it’s been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. On the monetary policy
front, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-japan-leaves-policy-unchanged-as-widely-expected-20250501/&quot;&gt;BoJ&lt;/a&gt; kept interest rates unchanged as expected and
delivered a dovish message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was then echoed by BoJ
Governor Ueda which placed a great deal on trade developments. In summary, the
central bank is likely to go faster on rate hikes in case we get a good trade
deal and delay rate adjustments in case the trade deal disappoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY continues to erase the April losses and it’s now approaching
the major trendline. The sellers will likely lean on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; with a defined risk above it to
position for a drop back into the 140.00 handle, while the buyers will look for
a break higher to increase the bullish bets into the 151.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we have now an upward trendline defining the bullish structure on this
timeframe. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better
risk to reward setup around the trendline, while the sellers will look for a
break lower to increase the bearish bets into new lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor upward trendline defining the bullish momentum on this
timeframe. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing
into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the
pullback into the next trendline. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The usual commentary is continuing by the ECB for the time being. Traders are pricing in a ~90% probability of a rate cut for their next policy decision in June. So, there&apos;s not much change to the rhetoric and narrative for now.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This is as what you&apos;d expect from China ahead of the talks tomorrow. The question now is, are we going to see the US drop its tariff levels before both sides sit down at the table over the weekend? It&apos;s certainly a consideration, particularly after this report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/white-house-weighing-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-report-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That will help to at least try and build a starting point for trade discussions. But knowing China, they won&apos;t accept anything less than going back to where things were before. So, we&apos;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, we have a pretty empty agenda with just a couple of low tier data releases that won&apos;t be market-moving. In the American session, we get the Canadian Employment report which is expected to show 2.5K jobs added in April and the Unemployment Rate to tick higher to 6.8% vs. 6.7% prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the day after the outline of the first trade deal and we have expectations for the US lowering the tariffs on China over the weekend so that&apos;s gonna be the main theme going into the weekend. As always, watch out for tariff related news throughout the day, especially potential retaliatory threats from other countries (EU) as the US stated that the 10% rate is going to be the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;08:40 GMT/04:40 ET - BoE&apos;s Bailey (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;09:55 GMT/05:55 ET - Fed&apos;s Barr (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:45 GMT/06:45 ET - Fed&apos;s Kugler (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12:30 GMT/08:30 ET - Fed&apos;s Barkin (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12:30 GMT/08:30 ET - Fed&apos;s Williams (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14:00 GMT/10:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Goolsbee (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15:30 GMT/11:30 ET - Fed&apos;s Waller (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23:45 GMT/19:45 ET - Fed&apos;s Cook (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23:45 GMT/19:45 ET - ECB&apos;s Schnabel (neutral - voter)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Looking to the day ahead, all eyes will be on any headlines in the build up to US-China talks over the weekend. You can surely expect Trump to say something before we wrap things up on the week.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are a couple to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The first one is for EUR/USD at the 1.1200 mark. Amid a firmer dollar, the expiries here could help to act as a bit of a floor for price action before we get to US trading. That is considering the likely quieter period in European trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, there is one for USD/JPY at the 145.00 level but it isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance. But the expiries could also keep a floor on price action, amid some extension of the range in play during the session ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, dollar and broader risk sentiment remains the bigger driver at the moment. So if we do see risk pick up, expect that to underpin the greenback as well with the expiries taking a backseat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;All eyes today though will be on any follow up trade headlines ahead of US-China talks over the weekend. That overrides everything else before we look to close out the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In overall terms, the numbers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-january-april-yuan-denominated-exports-75-yy-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; were much better than expected as China exports in particular held up. However, the devil is always in the details. China&apos;s exports to the US actually fell by nearly 18% on the month from March to April. So, what gives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is basically this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/how-china-has-been-preparing-itself-ahead-of-this-tariffs-eventuality-with-the-us-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;How China has been preparing itself ahead of this tariffs eventuality with the US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;China is pretty much just rerouting goods by origin washing as exports to Vietnam especially surged on the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The good news for the US is that perhaps this might even just be a temporary thing. After speaking to US retailers last week, Trump looks to have given some assurance of sorts as we&apos;re starting to even see a pick up in China container ships leaving for the US now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Is this a start of a return to some form of new normality? If so, it&apos;s possibly a hint that the US will lower China tariffs as we look to talks over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

The comments signal a slower path ahead for deepening trade ties in Asia.

Imports fell a modest 0.2%, a smaller decline than forecast and an improvement from March, though underlying domestic demand remains weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1897&quot; data-end=&quot;2067&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;China&apos;s goods trade totalled 14.14 trillion yuan ($1.96 trillion) in the first four months, up 2.4% year-on-year, with the pace of growth picking up slightly from Q1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2071&quot; data-end=&quot;2249&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin climbed toward USD 104,000 amid reports that El Salvador had resumed government purchases.

                            &lt;p&gt;The numbers are here, exports did not plunge as feared. They were lower than in March, but the pipelines were jammed full in March ahead of more Trump tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-january-april-yuan-denominated-exports-75-yy-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;April figures, in US dollar terms: exports +8.1% y/y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting on my sceptical hat for a minute .... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are sometimes questions about the veracity of Chinese data. This has been ramped a little higher in the present environment, especially going into the weekend when the US and China begin tentative trade talks. Neither side wants to display weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the US its been bluster about a stack of deals coming in in the weeks ahead (yeah, right), supported by a lack lustre &apos;framework&apos; of an agreement&apos; with the UK. From China we had tough talk just today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-vice-foreign-minister-hua-on-us-trade-talks-come-on-we-have-no-fear-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;China Vice Foreign Minister Hua: On US trade talks ... ‘come on. We have no fear.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we get decent export numbers? And ... the data came out as scheduled whereas normally we are kept waiting and waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, make up your own mind, but I&apos;m sceptical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUD off its low:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;United States cannot ‘sustain what it is doing’ in trade policy
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China has ‘full confidence’ in its ability to manage US trade issues
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China does not want a ‘war of any kind with any other country’
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China has ‘full capability to overcome difficulties’ amid trade war
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘Ordinary people’ in China do not want trade war but are confident
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On US trade talks, ‘if we have to face up to reality, come on. We have no fear.’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and the US meet in Geneva this weekend to take the first steps, tentative I imagine, on trade talks. &lt;/p&gt;
