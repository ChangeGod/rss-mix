                            &lt;p&gt;Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng said a joint statement would be released in Geneva on Monday. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Vice-Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said it would contain &quot;good news for the world&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As yet I haven&apos;t found a scheduled time for the release of this expected joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have had so far from official statements has been a bit vague, as posted much earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China side:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
a mechanism for further talks has been agreed (agreed to establish a &apos;China-US trade consultation mechanism&apos; )
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the joint statement to come will be &quot;good news for the world.&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;US side:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Bessent said there had been &quot;substantial progress&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greer said that &quot;perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for markets, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EUR/USD traded a gap lower very early Monday but has more or less converted that gap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USD/JPY gapped higher in early trade and has retraced around 50% of the gap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USequity index futures opened with a gap higher and have barely retraced at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil opened with a gap higher and has filled it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From earlier also:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;UK data - The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) employment intentions gauge fell from +13 to +8, the lowest level on record excluding the COVID-19 period&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large private-sector employers were the main contributors to the decline, reflecting broader uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIPD’s economist says hiring reluctance reflects weak business confidence amid rising costs and global uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (KPMG/REC) survey showed another decline in recruiter job placements, though the pace eased slightly from March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall demand for staff fell more sharply in April, reinforcing signs of a weakening labour market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data aligns with the Bank of England’s recent signals that the labour market is softening, despite ongoing concerns about high wage growth. Q1 official wage figures are due from the UK on Tuesday -  expected to show nearly 6% annual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CIPD puts median pay settlements at 3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIPD’s economist says hiring reluctance reflects weak business confidence amid rising costs and global uncertainty.

BDO employment gauge: BDO’s composite employment index hit a 12-year low in April, underlining the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;info via Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;While the news out of the weekend trade talk with China was long on feel goods it was very short on detail. This, on the other hand, appears to be more substantive. Its great news for those in the US reliant on medicines for their health. Trump says he&apos;ll be signing the order on Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S. will pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the world.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will sign order at White House at 9 a.m. on Monday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detail on how Trump will achieve this will be interesting to discover. We wait for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Biotech stocks look likely to be a casualty of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump &apos;tweet&apos;:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;China&apos;s Vice Premier He Lifeng described the weekend talks with U.S. officials as an important first step in stabilising bilateral trade relations, acknowledging that while differences remain, saying frictions are unavoidable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He underscored that the fundamental nature of China-U.S. trade is a mutual win-win, pushing back against zero-sum rhetoric that has recently dominated political discourse.

He said Beijing is prepared to work with Washington to manage differences constructively, expand areas of cooperation, and “make the pie of cooperation bigger.” He also pledged that both sides would aim to inject greater “certainty and stability” into the global economy, framing the talks as a foundation for broader de-escalation and mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both China and the US have agreed to establish an “economic and trade consultation mechanism” that would involve recurring discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides are to issue a joint statement on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FX markets have marked the USD broadly higher. Note that its VERY early in Asia, only just after 5.30 am in Tokyo and 4.30 am in Singapore and Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand its just after 8.30 am and Sydney 6.30 am.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar is higher against both yen and euro in early FX trading (its VERY early, just after 5.20am in Tokyo and 4.20 in Singapore and Hong Kong).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US and China met in talks over the weekend in Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing of substance has been announced by either side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&apos;ve said they&apos;ll have announcements on Monday. Monday Asia time? That&apos;d be nice but I suspect it&apos;ll Monday in Europe/US time though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have got in the way of official comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China side:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a mechanism for further talks has been agreed (agreed to establish a &apos;China-US trade consultation mechanism&apos; )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the joint statement to come will be &quot;good news for the world.&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;US side:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bessent said there had been &quot;substantial progress&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greer said  that &quot;perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House issued a gushing statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sceptical of this, the comments from officials indicate not trade deal was actually reached. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;As is usual for a Monday morning, market liquidity is very thin until it improves as more Asian centres come online ... prices are liable to swing around, so take care out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the US and China are making upbeat comments on trade talk progress, but details are sparse of course. Its not bad news but its not great either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be back with more on this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US futures re open at 6pm US Eastern time (2200 GMT), until then we have early FX rates in response, USD/JPY up from Friday&apos;s close and EUR/USD down. Markets casting a sceptical eye over &apos;progress&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;TRADER-UPDATE: Trump Tweets &quot;Great Progress&quot; in U.S.-China Trade Talks - But Final Deal Remains Uncertain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has tweeted enthusiastically about recent trade discussions with China in Switzerland, calling them &quot;friendly but constructive&quot; and indicating that &quot;great progress&quot; has been made. While such optimism from Trump could be viewed positively, prompting market participants to anticipate a bullish outcome for equities and risk-sensitive currencies, investors and traders should proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Trump&apos;s upbeat tone could reflect genuine breakthroughs, potentially leading to significant benefits for American businesses and a reduction in trade tensions. If substantiated by concrete details, this development would be notably bullish for market sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can reasonably be assumed that the trade deal is far from finalized, as a definitive announcement or confirmation from other official channels would likely accompany such a critical milestone. Historically, optimistic statements from leaders—particularly Trump—have sometimes preceded challenging negotiations that have not immediately resulted in finalized agreements. Thus, Trump&apos;s message may primarily aim at shaping positive market sentiment rather than signaling a fully completed deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and traders should anticipate further negotiations and detailed announcements from both U.S. and Chinese officials. Until a solid, confirmed deal emerges, maintaining careful risk management remains essential amid potentially volatile trade-related headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in light of the lack of negative news, US futures (ES, NQ, RTY, YM) may open green in a few hours, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This sounds pretty good. US and Chinese negotiators are meeting again tomorrow so we&apos;re likely to get some details before the weekly open.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today there was a concerning escalation with  Indian cruise missiles hitting Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase. Earlier, there was also an Indian military facility in Beas hit by Pakistan, supposedly destroying a storage facility for Brahmos missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t confirm any of those reports but it looks like cooler heads have prevailed with both nuclear powers now declaring an immediate ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

We&apos;ll just have to see how it goes on the weekend and what China wants and is willing to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the world: The big question is &apos;who is willing to accept 10% and who isn&apos;t?&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

The US dollar generally sagged and that might reflect so anxiety about the US-China meeting scheduled for the weekend. Trump floated an 80% tariff rate for China so we&apos;ll see where that all lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, it likely tees up a big move to start next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro was strong early in US trade and continues higher to 1.1292 before stalling ahead of the figure and steadily retreating back to 1.1250 last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/JPY fell at the same time to a session low of 144.83 before recovering 50 pips. It remains the main source of FX volatility as the market weighs tariff outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one comment from Williams that stood out to me was him highlighting &apos;considerably&apos; slower growth coming. That&apos;s a different tune from Powell, who repeatedly emphasized the strength in economic data to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for economic reports, the lone notable one was from Canada. The headline was slightly better than expected but the report showed 37K public admin jobs added in what was largely temporary hiring for the election that will unwind in the month ahead. The unemployment rate rose to 6.9% from 6.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to some Canadian dollar underperformance, though not in a big way is it&apos;s mostly the trade war that&apos;s driving moves.&lt;/p&gt;
