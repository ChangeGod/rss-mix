                            &lt;p&gt;China&apos;s major state banks expected  to cut their deposit rates today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;will cut rates on some fixed-term deposits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no indication of the scale of the rate cuts has been given&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts would be part of stimulus efforts from China. The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said a 10 basis point cut will lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.The monthly LPR fixing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/economic-calendar-in-asia-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cut-expected-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;due at 0100 GMT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPR cuts should help banks lower their funding costs. Chinese banks are under pressure to support economic growth amid a property crisis, weak loan demand and record low interest margins.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P is closing higher for the 6th gain in a row. The Dow is up for 3 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markets shook off the early-day declines due to the late Friday Moody&apos;s downgrade of the US debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Dow was down  -317 points at session lows, but is closing up 137.33 points or 0.32% at 42792.07&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The S&amp;amp;P was down -62.69 points at session lows, but is closing up 5.22 points or 0.09% at 5963.60.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NASDAQ index was down -273.68 points at session lows, but is closing up 4.36 points or 0.02% at 19215.46&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The G7 meting listed in the calendar is the meeting opg G7 finance minister and central bankers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China will be setting their Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;74&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current LPR levels are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;76&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;76&quot; data-end=&quot;133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;78&quot; data-end=&quot;133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;One-year LPR: 3.10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;134&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;136&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Five-year LPR: 3.60%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;233&quot; data-end=&quot;391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These rates have remained unchanged since October 2024, when the PBOC implemented a 25 basis point reduction for both maturities. The one-year LPR primarily influences corporate and household loans, while the five-year LPR serves as a reference for mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;190&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;LPRs are no longer as important as they once were. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC) shifted its primary monetary policy tool to the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) rate. This transition began in mid-2024. This move aligns China&apos;s monetary policy framework more closely with global standards, such as those of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which typically rely on a single short-term policy rate to guide market expectations and liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;192&quot; data-end=&quot;350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 7-day reverse repo rate is a short-term interest rate used in the PBOC&apos;s open market operations to manage liquidity in the banking system. By adjusting this rate, the PBOC influences short-term borrowing costs, which in turn affect broader financial conditions, including the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), a key reference for lending rates in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;352&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of May 8, 2025, the PBOC reduced the 7-day reverse repo rate by 10 basis points to 1.40%, marking the first cut since September 2024. This reduction is part of a broader strategy to stimulate the economy amid challenges such as trade tensions and a slowing property market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;352&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of more focus is the Reserve Bank of Australia, widely expected to cut its cash rate by 25bp today, and further in the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/75bp-of-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cuts-to-come-reuters-poll-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;75bp of Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts to come (Reuters poll)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of the big 4 Australian banks ANZ, CBA and WPAC are tipping a 25bp cut, NAB a 50bp cut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This zone, which had previously acted as a support floor and more recently as resistance, once again attracted sellers, leading to a downside reversal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;368&quot; data-end=&quot;802&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Following the rejection at resistance, the pair has rotated lower and is now testing a key support zone defined by the 200- and 100-hour moving averages, currently at 1.1208 and 1.1197, respectively. These levels will serve as important short-term bias indicators. Holding above the MAs would keep the door open for renewed upside attempts. However, a sustained move below would tilt the bias back in favor of the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;804&quot; data-end=&quot;1052&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Should the pair break below the moving average cluster, attention will turn to the Friday low at 1.1130, followed by the low from last week at 1.10636, and then the 38.2% retracement of the January 2025 low to the April high at 1.10395.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;945&quot; data-end=&quot;957&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;958&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;958&quot; data-end=&quot;1031&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;88&quot; data-end=&quot;111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance Targets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;112&quot; data-end=&quot;288&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;112&quot; data-end=&quot;201&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;114&quot; data-end=&quot;201&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1265–1.1276: Key swing area; failed break today; former support turned resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;202&quot; data-end=&quot;236&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;204&quot; data-end=&quot;236&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1345: Trendline resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;290&quot; data-end=&quot;310&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support Targets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;311&quot; data-end=&quot;521&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;311&quot; data-end=&quot;348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;313&quot; data-end=&quot;348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1208: 200-hour moving average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;349&quot; data-end=&quot;386&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;351&quot; data-end=&quot;386&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1197: 100-hour moving average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;387&quot; data-end=&quot;413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;389&quot; data-end=&quot;413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1130: Friday’s low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;414&quot; data-end=&quot;447&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;416&quot; data-end=&quot;447&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.10636: Low from last week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;448&quot; data-end=&quot;521&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;521&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.10395: 38.2% retracement of the move up from the January 2025 low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;SNB Chairman Schlegal is on the wires saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB will tolerate negative inflation rate in the short term&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty is currently very high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swiss franc is often sought as a safe haven in times of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy rate is our main instrument, but when necessary we can intervene in the forex market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The outlook for Swiss inflation is currently very unclear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no alternative to US treasuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB is not a currency manipulator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It only intervened to pursue our mandate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have only intervened to slow overvaluation of the franc, not to gain a competitive advantage for Switzerland.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHF is modestly weakening vs the USD but remains below the 200 hour MA at 0.83504. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the EURCHF, the price is above is just above teh 100 hour MA at 0.9375. The corrective low off the high today was above the 200 hour moving average of 0.9360.  Staying above the MAs is a bullish tilt, at least in the short-term. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major European indices closed mixed on the day. Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB closed down -1.20% at 40166.76. The move to the downside took the price off the highest level going back to 2008 for the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX rose 0.71% and closed at a new record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the closing level shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax Rose 167.65 points or 0.71% at 23935.09&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC felt -3.07 points or -0.04% at 7883.63.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 rose 14.74 points or 0.17% at 8699.31.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex rose 34.50 points or 0.25% at 14099.00.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB fell -489.51 or -1.20% at 40166.76.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As London/European traders head for the exits, US stocks are rebounding from lower levels. The Dow industrial average is currently positive on the day. The S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices are&apos;s marginally lower but well off lows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial Average up 24.66 points or 0.06% at 42678. The Index was down -317.03 points at session allows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -10.7 points or -0.18% at 5947.70. The Index was down -62.69 points at session lows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index minus 69.5.2 or -0.36% at 19141.10. The Index was down -273.68 points at session lows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading up $0.58 or 0.94% at $62.55. The price is near the high for the day at $62.67.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading up $28.32 or 0.89% at $3230.17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $1747 at $104,771&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields have come off their high levels. The 30 year yield was back about 5% earlier in the day. It is now back below the key level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.993%, +1.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5- year yield 4.096%, +3.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.496%, +5.6 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.962%, +6.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fed&apos;s Williams (speaking to reporters?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty has led the Fed to keep interest rates steady so far this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path forward might not become clearer for months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s not going to be that in June, we&apos;re going to understand what&apos;s happening more in July&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s going to be a process of collecting data, getting a better picture, and watching those things develop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;71&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD is under pressure to start the new trading week, with sellers regaining more control following last weeks rejection of the 200-day moving average (green line currently at 1.40144). The pair had stalled near that level on two separate times last week, leading to renewed downside interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;71&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After trading above and below the 100-hour moving average (blue line currently at 1.39582), the price today has now fallen back below both that 100-hour and also the 200-hour moving averages (now at 1.39347), tilting the near-term bias more bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;810&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is now targeting the swing area between 1.38917 and 1.3904, which served as resistance earlier in April before breaking higher on May 8 and forming a floor.  That area could act as support on more selling and a retest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;810&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below that zone would open the door to further downside, with the next technical support seen near the 1.3860 region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;812&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;838&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;838&quot; data-end=&quot;953&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;840&quot; data-end=&quot;953&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.39347 (200-hour MA), 1.39582 (100-hour MA), 1.40097–1.40268 (swing area and the 200-day MA and daily resistance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;954&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;956&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38917–1.3904 (swing area), then 1.38607&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1011&quot; data-end=&quot;1173&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are more in control while price holds below the key hourly moving averages. A move back above the 100-hour MA would be needed to ease the downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;94&quot; data-end=&quot;389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is starting the week on stronger footing, benefiting from broad U.S. dollar weakness following Friday’s Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;391&quot; data-end=&quot;700&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, the AUDUSD has extended above both the 100-hour (0.64228) and 200-hour (0.64327) moving averages, signaling a more bullish bias in the short term.  The price has been waffling above and below those MAs as the price action consolidates near highs for the year (and going back to November 2024 - not shown). The pair is also currently testing the 200-day moving average at 0.64558, a critical hurdle for further upside momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;702&quot; data-end=&quot;963&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the bullish tone strengthening, traders are now eyeing the next resistance zone between 0.6493 and 0.65135—the upper extreme from earlier in 2025. A break above that area would mark a key technical victory and open the path to broader upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;965&quot; data-end=&quot;989&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.64327 (200-hour MA), 0.64228 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.64558 (200-day MA), then 0.6493–0.65135 (2025 high area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1279&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Holding above the rising moving averages keeps the buyers in control, with a close above the 200-day MA likely to encourage further bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Market shake-up: Tech edges up while energy and consumer stocks drag</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market today exhibits a diversified portfolio of trends, as revealed by the latest heatmap snapshot. Technology stands out marginally in the green, while energy and major consumer stocks face notable downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📊 Technology: Microsoft (MSFT) leads the tech sector with a slight increase of 0.29%, reflecting a cautious optimism among investors. However, Oracle (ORCL) remains nearly flat with a minimal gain of 0.04%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💡 Semiconductors: Challenges continue as Nvidia (NVDA) marks a 0.26% drop and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slips by 2.02%, pointing to ongoing volatility in this critical subsector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🚗 Consumer Cyclical: Tesla (TSLA) experiences a sharp decline of 3.04%, intensifying concerns over the auto manufacturer&apos;s performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏦 Financials: Visa (V) shows resilience with a 0.71% rise, contrasting JPMorgan Chase&apos;s (JPM) slight dip of 0.11%. Bank of America (BAC) is up 0.47%, contributing to mixed sentiments in this sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🩺 Healthcare: AstraZeneca (AZN) rockets up by 2.81%, while Eli Lilly (LLY) shows a notable drop of 0.95%, emphasizing the variability within the sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market sentiment reflects a cautious optimism mingled with sector-specific concerns. Tech&apos;s marginal gains underscore investor interest, but the downturn in energy and consumer cyclical sectors suggests brewing caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall in semiconductor stocks aligns with broader tech concerns, driven possibly by global supply chain disruptions and regulatory issues. The bleak performance in energy, with companies like Chevron (CVX) down 2.67%, hints at fluctuating oil prices influencing investor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering today&apos;s varied market dynamics, diversification remains key. Investors are advised to watch tech stocks like Microsoft for potential gains amidst volatility and consider rebalancing portfolios to offset energy sector risks. The healthcare sector&apos;s fluctuations suggest cautious observation, particularly with strong performers like AstraZeneca. Keep an eye on value stocks in financials to hedge against instability, and check regularly for updates on ForexLive.com for comprehensive insights, especially in these rapidly shifting markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;84&quot; data-end=&quot;237&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF is trading weaker to start the week as the U.S. dollar faces broad pressure following Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit late Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;239&quot; data-end=&quot;491&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, Friday’s rally attempt failed to hold above the 100-hour moving average (blue line), and sellers have since taken the pair below the 200-hour moving average (green line) at 0.83496. That level now acts as close resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;493&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, today’s low found buyers within a key swing area between 0.8318 and 0.8333—a former ceiling that is now serving as a support floor. Traders will look to that zone for clues about the next directional move. Holding above it keeps the door open for a retest of resistance; a break below would open the path toward the next lower target area near 0.8272.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;867&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;939&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;939&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8349 (200-hour MA), 0.8375 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;940&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;942&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8318–0.8333 (swing area), then 0.8272 to 0.8280 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1072&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum favors sellers, but watch the 0.8318–0.8333 floor for signs of a shift.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fund managers haven&apos;t felt the FOMO yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All year, retail investors have been piling into stocks while fund managers have lightened up. With the huge rebound in stocks, many fund managers are no doubt wishing they had bought the dip but the latest survey from Bank of America shows they&apos;ve remained cautious, with allocations to US equities at the lowest since May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of that might be trickling abroad as several global stock markets hit records last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t argue with the success retail has had in the past month but in the long history of retail vs institutional, it&apos;s almost always best to be on the institutional side.&lt;/p&gt;
