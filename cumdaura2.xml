That put the BOE Chair Bailey in the hot seat as he maneuvered through Q&amp;amp;A questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rate cut, the BOE’s guidance remained unchanged, emphasizing a “gradual and careful” approach to easing—repeating the tone from March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the US and the UK announced the framework for a trade deal. According to US commerce Sec. Lutnick, the deal adds US$5 billion of opportunity for US exporters, and keeps a 10% tariff on all goods in place. He added that UK would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes. The US said that they would allow Rolls-Royce engines and plan parts to come over tariff free and exempted Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles from tariffs as well (thank goodness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trump, he and PM Starmer reached an agreement that will increase access for U.S. beef and ethanol, while also committing to reduce non-tariff barriers. As part of the deal, the UK will fast-track U.S. goods through customs, allowing for quicker movement in both directions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final details of the agreement are expected to be finalized in the coming weeks - a sentiement expressed by UK officials as well. Additionally, the U.S. will gain new market access for chemicals and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Josh Brown on CNBC said sarcastically, &quot;The US reached an agreement with its strongest ally for the last 200 plus years. Amazing news.&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Trump spoke of confidence for the forthcoming meetings with China over the weekend, and the NY Post, reported that the US may cut tariffs on China goods to 50% by as early as next week. Trump said the best a country can do is 10% tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks were supported with gains now over the last 2 trading days after declines on the first 2 days of the week. For the day and the week (with one day to go):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow rose 0.62%, and holding to a 0.12 gain for the week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P rose 0.58%, but is still down -0.40% for the week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq rose 1.07% but is down -0.28% for the week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the week will decide up or down for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD move up vs the major currencies.  A snapshot of the greenbacks gains vs the currencies showed the strongest gain vs the JPY (+1.45%) and the smallest gain vs the AUD (+0.34). The EUR fell -0.54% vs the USD and the GBP in volatile up and down trading on all the headline news, fell -0.37%.  The CHF rose 1.01% vs the USD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields moved higher helping to support the USD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.880%, +8.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield 3.986%, +11.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.380%, +10.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.846%, +7.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US auctioned off $25B of 30 year bonds but was met with tepid demand (0.7 basis point tail and lower than average Bid to cover).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil rose $2.17 or 3.74% to $60.24&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold fell $60 or -1.79% to $3304.98&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin rose $5558 or 5.73% to $102,608&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The New York Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/business/us-weighs-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-as-soon-as-next-week-sources/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that the US is weighing a plan to slash China tariffs to as low as 50% next week from 145%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;US officials are discussing a proposal to lower President Trump’s punishing levy on China goods to between 50% and 54% as they begin what promise to be lengthy talks to hammer out a trade agreement, sources close to the negotiations said&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs on neighbouring south Asian countries would be cut to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s crazy how much of this already appears to have leaked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In response, a “whisper” campaign spread quickly and “the number that emerged to get the ships flowing out of China was 54%,” said Jay Foreman, CEO of Basic Fun, which makes its retro toys in China including Tonka Trucks, Care Bears and My Little Pony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The signals we are getting is that the dam will break by the end of this week or next, that there will be an adjustment,” Foreman told The Post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Accordingly, many retailers already have begun asking vendors to quote prices based on a range of tariff rates — anywhere between 10% and 54% — “so they are ready to price when the goods land” in the US, Foreman added.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t have insider information, this market is tough to trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The retailers behavior changed after the White House meeting as if they got some confidence,” said retail guru Gerald Storch, a former CEO of Toys R Us and Canadian based department store company HBC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 took quite a jump that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today Trump said to &apos;buy stocks&apos; and plenty of people did because it was reminiscent of his message a few hours before he removed the reciprocal tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;145&quot; data-end=&quot;712&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, as widely expected, but the surprise came in the vote split. The decision passed with a 7-2-0 vote, falling short of the anticipated unanimous 9-0-0. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden pushed for a deeper 50 basis point cut, while Catherine Mann and Huw Pill unexpectedly voted to keep rates unchanged at 4.50%. That unexpected hawkish dissent triggered a kneejerk reaction in sterling, with GBPUSD spiking from around 1.3241 to 1.3344 before fading and rotating back toward session lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;714&quot; data-end=&quot;1047&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the rate cut, the BOE’s guidance remained unchanged, emphasizing a “gradual and careful” approach to easing—repeating the tone from March. As in previous meetings, markets quickly shifted focus from the headline rate move to the vote distribution, which revealed a more divided Monetary Policy Committee than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1049&quot; data-end=&quot;1620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the intraday reversal has turned the momentum back in favor of sellers. The pair has now retraced toward the day’s low at 1.3241, with a break below that level and the April 23 low at 1.3233 opening the door toward a swing area between 1.32017 and 1.32067. A move below that zone would target the 38.2% retracement of the April rally at 1.31603. With the price back under both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, sellers have short-term control—but they’ll need a break of those downside targets to confirm and extend the bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $59.91, up $1.84 or 3.17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price today reached $57.77. The high reached $60.02.  Technically, the price is closing above the 100/200 hour MAs at $58.30 and $59.15.  Getting and staying above those MAs gives the buyers some hope with the 38.2% of the move down from the April high at $61.63 as the next target. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar stormed ahead today, particularly USD/JPY which is now up 210 pips to 145.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on what&apos;s driving the move:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) A delayed reaction to the Fed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell was hawkish yesterday and the market has priced out about 40 basis points in Fed rate cuts in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The UK trade deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some element of smoke-and-mirrors with the UK trade deal but it&apos;s not devoid of substance. The US has been touting deals and got one here and the market may be anticipating more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The art of the deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&apos;s a preposterous idea to think the US can get away with a 10% tariff floor while asking other countries to bring down trade barriers but maybe I&apos;m wrong. The UK today lowered barriers for imports from the US and accepted -- at least for now -- a 10% tariff. And that&apos;s with the UK having a trade surplus with the USA. Maybe Trump really is a deal-making magician and he will roll more-meaningful US trade partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Trump sounded better on China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is the big one. He said that talks with China would be &apos;substantive&apos; and that tariffs would come down (though in part because &quot;they can&apos;t go any higher&quot;). It&apos;s not much but it&apos;s a change in tone and an indication that he expects progress this weekend. It&apos;s tough to read the tea leaves on this one but the market is sensing progress.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church has elected American Robert Prevost, 69, as its new leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the first American and the first native-English speaker to be named Pope but also speaks Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese and can read Latin and German. He has taken the name Leo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevost headed the Vatican Dicastery for Bishops, which is the office tasked with bishop appointments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are often worried about teaching doctrine, but we risk forgetting 
that our first duty is to communicate the beauty and joy of knowing 
Jesus,&quot; Prevost, in one of his few interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/papal-front-runner-interest-polyglot-us-cardinal-prevost-rises-italian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Vatican News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication said Prevost brings to the table pastoral experience in the peripheries with 
expertise in navigating the complexities of the church&apos;s central 
governance.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD has also broke to the downside as focus turns to the EU as a potential whipping dog for Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the prices also making a key break below support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price going back to April 15 and May 1 at 1.1265 was broken. Before that, the 61.8% retracement of the trading range since the 2020 high at 1.1271 and the swing high from 2023 at 12754 was broken. That area between 1.1265 and 1.1275 is now a risks defining level for sellers looking for more downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer risk level would be the broken 38.2% retracement of the trend move up from the March 27 well. That level comes in at 1.27505. Staying below that level gives the sellers a go-ahead to push lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key target would be the 50% midpoint at 1.11509. If the sellers are to restart their control, getting to that level is a level to aspire toward. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;216&quot; data-end=&quot;426&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDJPY is pushing higher today, supported by rising U.S. yields and a broader move higher in equities. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 6.2 basis points to 4.339%, providing a tailwind for the pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;428&quot; data-end=&quot;894&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, the price has now moved above its 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which comes in at 145.159—a bullish development. The next key upside target is the high from last week at 145.919, a level that previously stalled gains when the pair was testing that same 200-bar MA. Now that the moving average has drifted lower, that resistance stands as a more manageable hurdle—but still a significant one for bulls to clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;896&quot; data-end=&quot;1075&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above 145.919 would strengthen the bullish bias and expose the March low at 146.534, followed by the 38.2% retracement of the January–April decline at 147.138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1077&quot; data-end=&quot;1201&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers are making a play. The question now is whether they can sustain momentum and push beyond the key resistance zone. Close risk is now the broken 200 bar moving average at 145.159.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Risk assets are running today and crypto is flying. Bitcoin is up 4.7% to $101K in the first break above that level since early February. Ethereum is up nearly 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market likes what it heard about Trump&apos;s trade deal with the UK. The President was also upbeat on talks with China and said they will be &apos;substantial&apos; and advised people to buy stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has the market thinking more good news will be coming on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without that, bitcoin has shown some impressive resilience lately and that built the foundation for the recent rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting development today relates back to this tweet from March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweet caused a short-lived rally in those coins but later led to consternation and Trump hastily tweeted something else about including bitcoin and ETH as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/ballard-trump-wiles-lobbyist-00333953&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;writes &lt;/a&gt;that a powerful lobbyist was behind the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;story-text__paragraph  &quot;&gt;On a Sunday morning in early March, President Donald Trump greenlit a Truth Social post promoting a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Hours later, he felt like he’d been played.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;story-text__paragraph  &quot;&gt;That weekend at Mar-a-Lago, an 
employee of the lobby shop run by Brian Ballard who was attending a 
donor event at the resort, had personally buttonholed the president and 
encouraged him multiple times to tout his desire to promote the 
industry. She even gave him a copy of a message she thought he should 
write.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It
 was only after he posted that missive that Trump realized a company 
behind one of the tokens named in the post, Ripple Labs, was a Ballard 
client. He was furious and felt like he’d been used, according to two 
people familiar with the incident who were granted anonymity to speak 
candidly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“He is not welcome in anything 
anymore,” the president told associates at the White House that month, 
the people said, referring to Ballard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s an interesting look at how things get done in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Trump trade deal with the UK is igniting stocks with the major indices all up by over 1.4%. And Trump said &quot;Better go out and buy stocks now&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snapshot of the market currently shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average is trading up 576 points or 1.40% at 41688.78. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index is up 78.23 points or 1.40% at 5709.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index is trading up 317 points or 1.79% at 18053.90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major indices all closed higher yesterday snapping a 2-day decline to start the new trading week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is now up 0.44% for the week while the S&amp;amp;P index is at a similar 0.42%. The Dow industrial average is leading the way with a gain of 0.93%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK deal was somewhat low-hanging fruit. Discussions with China this weekend in Switzerland will be more important as will trade deals with Europe, Canada, Mexico and Japan. China currently has tariffs of 145% which has stopped shipments into the US ports. Jobs at the docks and with truck drivers are at risk.  How low can tariffs go on some progress from the meeting?  Does it make a difference whether it&apos;s 75% or 145%?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said lower imports represented a $1.1 billion benefit to the US so a &quot;slowdown is the good thing&quot;..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, European indices are mostly higher with modest gains in Spain, and declines in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +1.08%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frances CAC, +0.89%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 -0.32%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex +0.06%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +1.71%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX is closing just below the record high at 23420 going back to March 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB is pushing the March 19 hi close at 39712.65&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Well there it is. Trump is talking like 10% is the floor, answering a big question in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Trump often says one thing and does another but that doesn&apos;t bode well for making many deals.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;147&quot; data-end=&quot;527&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is trading back to the downsideas sellers leaned early against key resistance levels (near 100 and 200 hour MA) and instead pushed toward a critical support zone. The price has now returned to a key support area between 1.1265 and 1.12754, a zone that previously acted as a springboard for upside moves. This level is once again being tested, and its ability to hold will be crucial for near-term directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;529&quot; data-end=&quot;778&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair remains below both the 100-hour moving average (currently near 1.1339) and the 200-hour moving average (near 1.1327), reinforcing the bearish tone. Over time, unless EURUSD can break back above those moving averages, sellers remain in control at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;780&quot; data-end=&quot;1079&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below 1.1265 would increase downside pressure and shift the focus toward the next major target at 1.12505, which corresponds to the 38.2% retracement of the 2024 rally. Further declines would expose support near 1.1200 to 1.1213 and 1.11509, where the 50% retracement level resides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1081&quot; data-end=&quot;1268&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For bulls to regain control, the price needs to move back above the 100/200-hour MAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1442&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support Levels:
• 1.1265–1.1275 = Key support zone
• 1.12505 = 38.2% retracement of 2024 move
• 1.1200–1.1213 = Swing area
• 1.11592 = 50% retracement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1444&quot; data-end=&quot;1572&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance Levels:
• 1.1327 = 100-hour MA
• 1.1339 = 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1579&quot; data-end=&quot;1653&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch for price action around 1.1265—this is the battleground for control.&lt;/p&gt;
