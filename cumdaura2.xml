                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As we look to close out the week, there isn&apos;t too much on the expiries list to take note of. There is perhaps arguably just one for USD/JPY at 146.00 but it doesn&apos;t tie to any technical significance. As such, I wouldn&apos;t expect the expiries to have much impact. The market at the moment is largely riding on trade developments and will look to the US jobs report later for some little anecdotes to work with. All that before the weekend comes along. 🎵&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are up 0.7% on the day and that sets up the cash index to eye a potential ninth consecutive day of gains. It&apos;s been an impressive rebound in Wall Street to say the least, on what has been a lot talking the talk but nothing about walking the walk just yet. This time around, China is the one reportedly delivering some hopeful optimism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-says-the-us-has-sought-to-begin-trade-talks-china-says-its-thinking-about-it-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Is that opening a slight gap in the door for Trump? We&apos;ll see. But for now, we&apos;re not at the point of picking up the phone just yet on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In any case, the S&amp;amp;P 500 now looks poised to recover the 61.8 Fib retracement of the fall since February as the rebound continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That is encouraging but there will be bigger technical hurdles to get through just above that. The 100 (red line) and 200-day (blue line) moving averages will present key challenges before thinking about retesting the highs near 6,000 to 6,100 again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides trade developments, we also had Amazon and Apple earnings come in. And while both delivered better than estimates, the latter does have a caveat. Greater China sales roughly met estimates with a $16.0 billion figure but that is down a little over 2% compared to a year ago. That is evident of a shift in spending mindset and perhaps the toll taken from the US-China trade rhetoric spilling over into consumer behaviour. If anything, we&apos;ll likely see this figure shrink the longer the trade war rages on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for the day ahead, there will also be the US jobs report to look out for. Any thinking of layoffs in logistics and retail related to tariffs should be quickly dispelled here as it is still too early to see that show up in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It will still take a few months of hard data hitting hard before really leading to freight and trucking services to cut labour costs. But when it starts to hit, the cascading effect can be quick to catch on. So, just be wary of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As such, the non-farm payrolls data today shouldn&apos;t be too much of a factor besides looking into the wider impact of DOGE layoffs. If you&apos;re looking for any impact from tariffs here, this isn&apos;t the time yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And that means trade headlines or should I say Trump headlines, will continue to take on more importance.&lt;/p&gt;

Hopes
for a thaw in US-China trade tensions gained momentum Friday after
Beijing confirmed that Washington had recently conveyed, repeatedly, a desire to
start negotiations. “The US has recently sent messages to China
through relevant parties, hoping to start talks,” China’s
Commerce Ministry said, adding that “China is currently evaluating
this.” The ministry noted that the US has repeatedly expressed
interest in addressing tariff issues. Markets took the signals as a
tentative step toward dialogue, with oil prices and US equity index
futures moving higher on optimism that the world’s two largest
economies might be preparing to re-engage. In Washington, Senator
Marco Rubio echoed the sentiment, saying “the Chinese want to meet
and talk,” suggesting the ice may finally be starting to break.
Investors broadly interpreted the tone shift as a potentially
face-saving off-ramp for Trump, and a developing path forward for
China, particularly as economic cracks begin to emerge more visibly
in the recent data on both sides of the Pacific. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Still,
Beijing&apos;s tone was far from conciliatory. China’s Commerce Ministry
stressed that “if the US does not correct its unilateral tariff
measures, it has no sincerity at all” and that Washington must be
“prepared to take action in correcting erroneous practices,
including cancelling unilateral tariffs.” While China confirmed it
is open to dialogue, officials made clear that any talks would be
conditional on tangible US concessions. These statements, some
analysts argue, amount to Beijing effectively demanding a full
rollback of Trump-era tariffs as a precondition for serious
engagement — a stance that could complicate efforts to rekindle
negotiations. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Earlier
in the session, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato made
headlines by suggesting that Japan’s substantial holdings of U.S.
Treasuries could be considered a potential bargaining chip in trade
negotiations with Washington — though he was quick to clarify that
there is no intention to deploy that option at this stage. Japan’s
lead negotiator on tariffs, Ryosei Akazawa, struck a more measured
tone, and notably indicating that the next round of talks may not take place
until after mid-May — a sign that a breakthrough is unlikely
anytime soon. Both officials confirmed that foreign exchange issues,
i.e. the yen, were not discussed. Later, Prime Minister Fumio
Ishiba reinforced Japan’s longstanding position, stating that
Tokyo, like Beijing, continues to urge the U.S. to remove its tariff
measures. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Australia
heads to the polls on Saturday, May 3, with Prime Minister Anthony
Albanese still favoured to retain government — though polling
remains tight, and the prospect of a minority government cannot be
ruled out. On the economic front, March retail sales data released today showed a modest
improvement from February but fell short of expectations, while Q1
retail sales were flat overall — a notably weak result. Meanwhile,
producer price inflation (PPI) for the quarter came in above headline
CPI, highlighting lingering cost pressures. However, none of the data
releases shifted market expectations for a 25 basis point rate cut
from the Reserve Bank of Australia when it meets on May 19–20.. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;As mentioned, oil
and equities were broadly underpinned amid easing US-China tensions,
while major currency pairs saw mixed performance. USD/JPY briefly
spiked toward 145.80 but later retraced, ending the session little
changed. Elsewhere, the US dollar weakened against most G10 peers,
with the AUD, GBP, NZD, and CAD all posting gains. EUR/USD was a
relative laggard, advancing more modestly compared to the broader
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a gap lower to open Globex evening trade ES soared on the China news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above is a CFD that tracks ES. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The January 2025 employment report is due from the US on Friday, May 2, 2025, at 0830 US Eastern time, 1330 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;You can see the consensus estimate in the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number in the right-most column is the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month) result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the range of expectations compared to the median consensus (the &apos;expected&apos; in the screenshot above) for the key data points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headline NFP number:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;25,000 to 195,000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment rate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;4.1% to 4.3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average hourly earnings m/m:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.2% to 0.4%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average hourly earnings y/y:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;2.8% to 3.9%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is knowledge of such ranges important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data results that fall outside of market low and high expectations tend to move markets more significantly for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprise Factor: Markets often price in expectations based on forecasts and previous trends. When data significantly deviates from these expectations, it creates a surprise effect. This can lead to rapid revaluation of assets as investors and traders reassess their positions based on the new information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychological Impact: Investors and traders are influenced by psychological factors. Extreme data points can evoke strong emotional reactions, leading to overreactions in the market. This can amplify market movements, especially in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk Reassessment: Unexpected data can lead to a reassessment of risk. If data significantly underperforms or outperforms expectations, it can change the perceived risk of certain investments. For instance, better-than-expected economic data may reduce the perceived risk of investing in equities, leading to a market rally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triggering of Automated Trading: In today’s markets, a significant portion of trading is done by algorithms. These automated systems often have pre-set conditions or thresholds that, when triggered by unexpected data, can lead to large-scale buying or selling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impact on Monetary and Fiscal Policies: Data that is significantly off from expectations can influence the policies of central banks and governments. For example, in the case of the NFP due today, a weaker jobs report will fuel speculation of sooner Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate cuts to come. A stronger report will diminish such expectations, with the Fed on hold for longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liquidity and Market Depth: In some cases, extreme data points can affect market liquidity. If the data is unexpected enough, it might lead to a temporary imbalance in buyers and sellers, causing larger market moves until a new equilibrium is found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chain Reactions and Correlations: Financial markets are interconnected. A significant move in one market or asset class due to unexpected data can lead to correlated moves in other markets, amplifying the overall market impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Comments from  China’s Commerce Ministry began with MofCom being couy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The
US has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties,
hoping to start talks with China,” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; “China
is currently evaluating this.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But turned confronting very quickly after:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In any possible dialogue, meeting, if US does not correct its ‘unilateral’ tariff measures, US has no sincerity at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US should show sincerity if it wants to talk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;US should be prepared to take action in correcting ‘erroneous’ practices, cancelling unilateral tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-says-the-us-has-sought-to-begin-trade-talks-china-says-its-thinking-about-it-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;China says the US has sought to begin trade talks, China says its thinking about it  ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, futures have leapt higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not dismissing the impact of shorts scrambling, these comments show at least some progress. China has gone from saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;No, we haven&apos;t had any discussions at all&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Maybe we&apos;ll think about it&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress of a kind. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Ahead of last Monday&apos;s Canadian election Adam posted on the risk for CAD -  minority government:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/there-is-one-canadian-election-outcome-that-could-hurt-the-loonie-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;There is one Canadian election outcome that could hurt the loonie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is also a risk for this weekend&apos;s election in Australia. Polling is currently favouring the incumbent Prime Minister Albanese, but its very close. The very real risk is Albanese wins but only in minority, just like Carney this week. He will then form government with the support of Greens and/or independents and that always risks a more open wallet and a hit to fiscal irresponsibility, what little there is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other near term risk is we won&apos;t get a clear result for many days after the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could provide a setback for AUD, apart from the trade storms currently underway hitting Australia&apos;s major trading partner, China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PM Albanese and opposition leader Dutton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the latest of about a dozen expedited requests the Trump administration has brought to the high court in the past three months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;asks to lift a court order blocking Trump’s plan to curtail or end so-called temporary protected status, or TPS, for Venezuelan nationals. People who are granted TPS get protection from deportation and are issued work permits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the Venezuelan TPS recipients will have until May 8 to file a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More at that link to the report above. &lt;/p&gt;

that each side knows what the other&apos;s terms for peace are&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;its going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this
brutal, brutal conflict &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Its not going anywhere, Bret. It&apos;s not going to end any
time soon,&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance&apos;s comments came during a Fox News interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialling back geopolitical tension such as ending this war, was a promise Vance and his boss made, it was always a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;That headline is via Reuters, recapping the bombshell remark from Kato &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-fin-min-kato-said-had-no-discussion-at-all-with-us-of-where-yen-fx-level-should-be-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  Kato made the comments while appearing on a television program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;172&quot; data-end=&quot;423&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kato is Japan’s Finance Minister. He said the country’s massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries could serve as a potential bargaining tool in trade negotiations with Washington — though he emphasized there’s no commitment to actually using that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;noted that while Japan&apos;s main reason for holding such large reserves is to maintain sufficient liquidity for possible yen intervention, &quot;we obviously need to put all cards on the table in negotiations. It could be among such cards.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; he was quick to add a caveat: &quot;Whether we actually use that card, however, is a different question.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;817&quot; data-end=&quot;991&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Japan holds around $1.27 trillion in foreign reserves, most of which analysts believe is in U.S. Treasury debt, though the government doesn’t publicly detail the composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;817&quot; data-end=&quot;991&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Threatening to offload some is a big step. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Analysts at Macquarie say that even if Trump reverses all his tariffs the US dollar is unlikely to fully recover all of its recent losses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They give three reasons :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any capital flight from the U.S. isn’t just about foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds, or public pension plans abroad selling their U.S. assets at the direction of foreign politicians&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And add a fourth reason on why foreign holders need to diversify away from the dollar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the reduction in the integrity of some US institutions and systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trust is blown, its very difficult to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie conclude that the USD will become less a must hold currency and more an alternative to a few omparable choices, citing the euro as an example. &lt;/p&gt;

That turn came as the market continues to shrug off tariff fears, which was helped by an ISM manufacturing report that wasn&apos;t as bad a feared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the US dollar held steady bids across the board and was particularly strong against USD/JPY after the BOJ refrained from hawkish talk earlier. That pair ultimately rose 250 pips before giving back about 25 late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other US dollar moves were much smaller as it was mostly yen selling on better risk appetite. The S&amp;amp;P 500 climbed for its 8th day in a row in a move that&apos;s beginning to squeeze shorts or create FOMO. Hassett helped to fuel the moves by saying that an announcement of a trade deal was coming later today, though we continue to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil market was lively as it was beaten up hard in early US trade before reversing. It was helped along by a Saudi denial of earlier reports that it was warning market participants that it was ready for an extended period of low prices. Brent fell to $59.30 before recovering to $61.85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday is non-farm payrolls and oftentimes that restrains volatility but the thinking of most is this: If it&apos;s strong it doesn&apos;t really matter because it was before the tariffs. If it&apos;s weak it could just be a one-off and much of the economy looked fine.&lt;/p&gt;
