                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;78&quot; data-end=&quot;405&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to consolidate between clearly defined range extremes with resistance near 0.8333 and support at 0.81952. Yesterday’s price action briefly pushed below that lower boundary, reaching a low of 0.8185 during the FOMC-related volatility, but buyers quickly stepped in, rejecting the downside break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;407&quot; data-end=&quot;644&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Currently, the pair is rotating around its 100- and 200-hour moving averages, which are clustered mid-range between 0.82395 (100-hour MA) and 0.82484 (200-hour MA). That positioning reflects a neutral, indecisive market bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;646&quot; data-end=&quot;703&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;To shift the technical outlook, traders will be watching:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;704&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;704&quot; data-end=&quot;760&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;706&quot; data-end=&quot;760&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above 0.8333 to increase bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;761&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back below 0.81952 to reignite downside pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;761&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100 and 200 hour MA midrange (0.82395 to 0.82484) are barometers for more bullish or more bearish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;825&quot; data-end=&quot;920&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the pair remains caught in a range as buyers and sellers battle for near-term control.&lt;/p&gt;

Bitcoin may soon hit new all-time highs as investment surges, says Standard Chartered&apos;s Geoff Kendrick. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $5.3B in inflows over the past three weeks.

                            &lt;p&gt;This is a bad sign for hopes that we could get back to 0%. It indicates that 10% is a floor and I don&apos;t think many countries are going to go for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the White House CNN reporter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Trump’s trade announcement with the UK will be limited in scope, heavy on future commitments &amp;amp; leave the existing 10% universal tariffs in place, a US &amp;amp; UK official tell Phil Mattingly [a fellow CNN reporter]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An optimist might hope that as some of those &apos;future commitments&apos; are met there is a path to removing the 10% so let&apos;s wait and see. But I just can&apos;t see major US trading partners rolling over on a deal like this. The UK is around 2.5% of US imports so it&apos;s not a big trading relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate report from the FT says this deal is initially focused on autos and steel. That matches&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-and-uk-close-to-trade-agreement-report-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; initial reporting&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that this deal is more about those two sets of tariffs than the 10% &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariff policy.&lt;/p&gt;

New York showed a 15K increase which was a outlier that caused the spike to 241K last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending April 26 were in New York (+15,418), Massachusetts
(+3,301), Georgia (+1,207), Puerto Rico (+1,012), and Nebraska (+570), while the largest decreases were in Connecticut
(-2,340), Rhode Island (-1,850), Missouri (-1,696), Michigan (-1,436), and Washington (-700).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jobs situation remains solid which keeps the Fed on hold.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Most of the market&apos;s focus will be on today&apos;s initial jobless claims report at the bottom of the hour (along with Q1 productivity data) but the report I&apos;m watching for is the March wholesale inventory report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus is for a 0.5% rise but I&apos;m looking for a higher number or a revision higher in the February data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US GDP fell on a surge in imports but those imports haven&apos;t appeared in inventories despite data like this chart, which shows imports of roughly two years worth of metals products ahead of steel/aluminum tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK confirmed that Trump&apos;s announcement later is to be an agreement for a trade deal, or at least the framework of one, and that sets the stage ahead of the 1400 GMT showing at the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Trump also got up and early to keep risk sentiment underpinned as he says that the agreement will be a &quot;full and comprehensive one&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, as things stand, media reports don&apos;t seem to have much of anything to show for. So, we&apos;ll see if Trump will deliver any major details in his announcement later. The only thing so far that we know is that the UK is looking to make concessions on food and agriculture in exchange for lower auto tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;US futures and European indices are staying buoyed as a result while in FX, the dollar held steadier earlier on but gave back some gains during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;EUR/USD fell to a low of 1.1270 early in the day but is now sticking just above 1.1300 with large option expiries at the figure level also perhaps attracting price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, USD/JPY is marked higher throughout with a push towards 145.00 as bond yields are also keeping up on the day. Besides that, USD/CHF is up 0.1% to 0.8245 but off earlier highs of 0.8290 and USD/CAD up slightly by 0.3% to 1.3885 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The pound was a decent mover late on as the BOE cut the bank rate by 25 bps to 4.25% as expected. However, it was the bank rate vote decision that raised eyebrows with two members voting to keep rates unchanged. That is seeing the decision being viewed as more of a hawkish rate cut and sterling jumped as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;GBP/USD moved up from 1.3250 to 1.3330 and is holding at the highs now as we look towards US trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Looking to the day ahead, the main focus will be on Trump&apos;s announcement later as that will set the tone for broader markets ahead of the weekend. As a reminder, there&apos;s also still talks with China due in Switzerland during the two-day break. So, that will be an important consideration for traders to consider in their approach going into next week.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;108&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank of England cut rates by 25 basis points, sending GBPUSD initially lower to the session’s low and briefly breaking below the recent support floor near 1.1254—an area that had held over the past week. However, the move quickly reversed as traders digested the mixed vote, which included dissenters on both sides of the consensus cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;945&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound took the pair back toward the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, currently between 1.33137 and 1.33335. So far, the rally has stalled in that area. A sustained move above the 200-hour MA would be needed to shift the technical bias more convincingly in favor of the buyers. It’s worth noting that the pair briefly traded above these levels on Tuesday and again attempted to hold above them yesterday, but upside momentum faded—helped in part by a post-FOMC rebound in the US dollar. PS Trump announced that a trade deal with the UK (the UK is the 7th largest trading partner with the US). PSS Trump tweets that Too Late Powell is a fool..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EURUSD is starting the US session modestly lower after testing key support between 1.12657 and 1.12754. The low price reached 1.12696.  On the topside the 100 and 200 hour MAs will be topside resistance between 1.13289 and 1.13404.  Like the GBPUSD, the price this week has moved above those MAs, but stalled.  Watching 1.12657 on the downside and 1.13404 on the topside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDJPY is pushing higher after breaking above the 100 hour MA (currently at 143.743) and the 38.2% retracement at 144.208.  On the topside the falling 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 145.184 is the next key target on more upside momentum. Recall from last week, the price stalled the high for the week at that MA level and that started the fall (from 145.87) to the low reached on Tuesday (at 142.35). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are higher to start the day helped by trade-deal hope. Pres. Trump also said he would ease chip constraints which has the likes of Nvidia and Broadcom trading higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the major indices, the futures are implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average is up 329 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P Index is up 54 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq index is up 265 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.822%, +2.9 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield 3.908%, +3.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.298%, +2.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year year 4.78%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;in other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading up $1.04 or 1.79% of $59.12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading down $18 or -0.54% at $3347.94&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up $2349 and $99,403&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus will be on initial jobless claims which spiked up to 241K last week.  Is it the start of a trend or just a glitch from Easter or some other weird seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The EU is deeming this to be a part of a &quot;mutually beneficial and balanced solution&quot; as both sides are seeking negotiations on trade. The €95 billion will cover a broad range of industrial and agricultural products. And adding to that, the EU is also seeking possible restrictions on certain exports of steel scrap and chemical products to the US worth €4.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;At the same time, the EU will launch a WTO dispute against the US on both reciprocal and auto tariffs for what it&apos;s worth. The full list of the targeted €95 billion worth of countermeasures can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/e9d50ad8-e41f-4379-839a-fdfe08f0aa96/library/fd09c397-b621-4dcd-be36-1684eb37e3fb/details?download=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Important to not just look at the trade impact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But important to also look at how financial markets have reacted to trade developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I feel more confident about the disinflation path than trade developments (when asked on voting intention)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I was very undecided of where we would be going to be today back in the last meeting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I was in the fairly undecided camp but a bit more confident now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If anything, you have to admire his candidness in the Q&amp;amp;A here. He admits to being rather undecided and unsure on where rates might be headed, given the uncertainty from US tariffs and global trade developments. And this considering that the UK is fairly insulated from any major fallout from a US-China decoupling. So, you have to wonder how difficult is must be for other central banks to navigate through this period.&lt;/p&gt;

But I would expect Bailey to deflect those questions. Besides that, Bailey is also just reaffirming that there doesn&apos;t seem to be much details coming to surface now on the trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sterling climbs on messy BOE vote split</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Similar to February, it&apos;s a case of focusing on voting intentions when it comes to the BOE reaction. The central bank moved to cut the bank rate by 25 bps to 4.25% as expected. However, the vote split is what is raising eyebrows as we look to digest the situation. Dhingra and Taylor voting for a 50 bps rate cut is somewhat expected but both Mann and Pill voting for the bank rate to be unchanged is the standout here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That is leading to traders leaning towards this as being more of a hawkish cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Once again, Mann is stealing the spotlight as she did with February when she voted for a 50 bps rate cut at the time. Today, she&apos;s siding with calling for the central bank not to move forward with a rate cut. So, I guess she has found back her hawkish roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As much as the vote split is looking rather messy here, let&apos;s take a step back to see what that actually means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Considering global trade developments lately, there&apos;s plenty for central banks and policymakers to debate. And let&apos;s face the facts, there&apos;s going to be differing opinions on that and what the impact from Trump&apos;s tariffs will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And that is perhaps what we&apos;re seeing here. In the case of the Fed and most other central banks, perhaps things are less transparent. All we get is the supposed &quot;consensus&quot; view/decision and policymakers have to do their part and show unanimity rather than be explicit about how they really feel at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But in the case of the BOE, the bank rate vote does what it does. It presents an opportunity for policymakers to express their desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;What I&apos;m saying is that the bank rate vote perhaps just reflects the debate that all other central banks are having, but not being upfront and frank about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Either way, it&apos;s a fact now that policymakers at the BOE are having mixed views. And that spells uncertainty on how the decisions in the coming months will play out.&lt;/p&gt;

GBP/USD is up to 1.3306 now from around 1.3250 before the decision. In terms of communique, there isn&apos;t much change to the statement whatsoever. The BOE maintains that they will continue with a &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;careful&quot; approach, similar to that in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Once again, it will be a repeat of February where the focus and attention will be placed on voting intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Back then, Catherine Mann voted for a 50 bps rate cut and that surprised markets with the reaction centering on that. This time around, it&apos;s the same with Mann voting to keep rates unchanged instead alongside Huw Pill.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;“Too Late” Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much! Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and “eggs”) down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S. — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF “TOO LATE!” ENJOY!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all expected Trump to be pissed about the Fed decision yesterday and here he comes with another post mocking the Fed Chair. The good thing is that he can&apos;t do anything about it and Powell will remain the Fed Chair until May 2026. After that even if Trump picks a Fed Chair he likes, the policy adjustments are decided on a majority basis.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The two-minute delay is to commemorate VE Day, so just be wary of that. As for what to expect, here is what analysts are saying ahead of the decision (h/t @ MNI Markets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;HSBC- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;There are a number of on-off doves who could join the more steadfast Ms Dhingra (Dave
Ramsden, Alan Taylor and Catherine Mann) in voting for a 50bp reduction&quot;- “It is not our central case that it will cut in June. But it is possible, and if the Committee also
thinks it is possible, it may want to signal that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Citi- 25 bps rate cut (9-0, 8-1, 7-2 votes all plausible)- “A unanimous vote for a 25bp cut looks plausible, though it is possible that external MPC
member Dhingra could see the need for additional, pre-emptive easing and vote for a 50bp
step&quot;- &quot;Our expectation is still for another hold in June, with cuts at every meeting this year thereafter&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;ING- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;The messaging from officials so far this year has
made us less convinced of that, and instead, we think the path of least resistance is for the
Bank to keep cutting rates once per quarter&quot;- &quot;That process could, however, continue for longer than markets are now pricing. We think
Bank Rate will fall to 3.25% by mid-2026 and possibly even a little lower than that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;JP Morgan- 25 bps rate cut (8-1 vote, Dhingra to vote for 50 bps)- &quot;There is a risk others consider a 50 bps cut too, e.g. Mann&quot;- &quot;Our best guess is that the BoE won’t drop “gradual and careful” from its guidance&quot;- &quot;There is a risk, however, that the BoE could revamp its guidance entirely, indicating that it
sees risks to inflation in both directions and is willing to respond as necessary&quot;- A pause in June is expected next before sequential cuts
between August and November to 3.50% by year-end&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Reuters reported that OPEC+ was considering to further speed up oil production hikes as Saudi Arabia signalled it was unwilling to prop up the market any longer amid poor compliance with production quotas from Iraq and Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market opened with a big negative gap, but there was no follow through, in fact the market started to slowly fill the gap and eventually we erased all the losses as if that never happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s been lots of focus on the supply side recently given the OPEC+ moves, but changes on the demand side could start to gather attention. In fact, we are finally getting some details on the first trade deals with the US set to announce a framework for a deal with the UK today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve laid out a non-consensus opportunity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/a-non-consensus-trade-opportunity-as-the-selloff-in-crude-oil-gathers-attention-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and today we might get the first catalyst for a rally depending on the details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see the negative gap that was eventually filled and the key resistance around the $60.00 level. The buyers will need to break above that resistance to target the $62-64 price area next. The sellers, on the other hand, will likely step in around the resistance with a defined risk above it to position for a drop back into the $55.00 level. This might even turn into a big double bottom, but we will need positive developments on the trade front.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come. Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Again, a lot of big words but the devil will be in the details. I would expect this to just be more of a skeleton/outline on what both sides are looking for in exchange. In other words, basically just look towards some form of tariffs reduction and concessions in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, this should be one of the more straightforward deals to be struck as the UK was not on the reciprocal tariffs list to begin with. This is due to the more balanced nature of trade between the two countries. So, the UK has &quot;only&quot; been slapped with the blanket 10% tariffs as well as tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So if getting a full deal here is already a long process, you can imagine how long it will take for other countries that are not as close an ally to the US. I&apos;d take Trump&apos;s &quot;many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation&quot; with a pinch of salt really.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is reported that the UK has agreed to give some concessions on food and agriculture imports from the US in exchange for lower tariffs on autos. The details of the exchange are still unclear as of yet, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s not so much a big deal for the US but for the UK at least, some 18% of its car exports do go to the US. As for the flip side, it is one thing to offer a concession allowing for more agriculture imports. But the issue here is that supposedly a lot of US produce do not even meet UK regulation standards. So, how will that be changed?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;This should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Press Conference at The Oval Office, 10A.M. Thank you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Again, that will be at 1400 GMT. We all already know now that it will be an agreement to the terms for a trade deal i.e. framework for the upcoming negotiations. The important part will be to see if there will be any follow up details though. US futures are continuing to race higher on the headline here, with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures now up 1.1% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report pretty much confirms that this is a &quot;heads of terms&quot; agreement. In other words, it is a preliminary agreement and a &quot;substantive&quot; step towards a full deal. As for the details, it is all still rather lacking at the moment. Sky&apos;s deputy political editor, Sam Coates, added that this is also a positive step ahead of the UK-EU summit on 19 May:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;I think it is politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU - or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The positive news on trade deals continue to boost the US Dollar. This has more to do with positioning rather than fundamentals for now. In fact, the short dollar trade has been one of the most crowded ones and therefore it&apos;s at risk of unwindings on positive news on the trade front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY is now up more than 0.6% on the day as the positive risk sentiment weighs on the Japanese Yen. For the USD, there&apos;s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; where we could see a bigger upside move if very good outcomes on the trade front make the market to reprice interest rate expectations all the way down to just one cut for the Fed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Technical Analysis – Trump’s announcement weighs on the precious metal</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed yesterday kept its
usual neutral stance and Fed Chair Powell didn’t offer anything in terms of
forward guidance citing elevated uncertainty. The event didn’t move gold since
there wasn’t anything new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What impacted gold negatively
was Trump saying that he would make a big announcement concerning a major trade
deal today. Reports are saying that it will be a framework for a trade deal
with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture, gold
remains in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid Fed
easing. But in the short-term positive news on the tariffs front or a hawkish
Fed could trigger more downside for gold as the market prices out
stagflationary fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that gold rallied back above the 3400 level recently on some negative tariff
related headlines. Trump’s announcement though triggered some downside on
positive expectations. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have
a better risk to reward setup around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt;, while the sellers will look for a
break lower to increase the bearish bets into the 2957 level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see the price recently broke above the key swing level at 3367 before extending
the rally above the 3400 level. The price fell back below the 3367 level and
from a risk management perspective, the sellers will likely want to see a
pullback into the level to position for further downside. The buyers, on the
other hand, will want to see the price rising back above the 3367 level to pile
in for a rally into a new all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor downward trendline now defining the current pullback. If
the price gets there, we can expect the sellers to lean on the trendline with a
defined risk above it to position for a drop into the 3258 level next. The
buyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish
bets into new highs. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures and
Trump announcing the outline for a trade deal with the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;
