I would expect even more improvement in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-months forward index jumped from 6.9 to 47.2 and the new orders one from 6.6 to 49.7. This just shows that we could really get a covid-like bullwhip scenario where we see a surge in demand and economic activity after the April&apos;s rout.&lt;/p&gt;

I wouldn&apos;t read too much into it though as it came after a strong month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some notable parts of the report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food services and drinking places +0.8% (there is high consumer sensitivity here)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clothing +0.9% (tariff front running?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building materials and garden +0.9% (good sign on housing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Furniture and home furnishings +1.4% (again, good for housing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicles +0.9% (tariff frontrunning?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grocery stores +0.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real weakness here is in grocery stores so overall I&apos;d say this report is a strong endorsement of the health of the consumer even after the tariff war kicked off. Some of that could be tariff front-running so we&apos;ll see if it holds up but it&apos;s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD and the GBPUSD have traded up and back down in trading today. The pairs are trading between the 100/200 hour MAs to start the day. The USDJPY is lower in trading today but did find support buyers near the lower 200 hour MA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video below, I go through the technical levels in play for the 3-major curency pairs to kickstart the US session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic calendar is full with a slew of varios releases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;0&quot;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report notes that although the US is considering to revise the agreement, the Japanese camp is not anticipating such a change. As such, there is a possibility that negotiations will meet a deadlock. The revision to the agreement seems to be centered around the possibility of the US requesting further concessions on agriculture and livestock products, according to the sources. And that is something that Japan has refused to budge from the initial discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, we&apos;ll just have to wait and see. But at least there&apos;s a possible timeline to look out for. Japan&apos;s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, could be travelling to Washington as soon as next week for a third round of trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The takeaway from the earnings call today comes from these remarks by Doug McMillon. He warned that Walmart is planning to raise prices on some items as Trump&apos;s tariffs are weighing on the firm&apos;s costing. And that these price hikes will begin later this month, despite the recent temporary reprieve between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If even Walmart has to be one to raise prices, you can surely expect smaller firms to also do so. That especially as it is going to be a messy logistical summer in sorting out supply chains. From before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/tariffs-policy-can-change-overnight-but-supply-chains-cannot-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Tariffs policy can change overnight but supply chains cannot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Adding to McMillon&apos;s remarks, Walmart finance chief, John David Rainey, also said that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;ll see how this all plays out in the months ahead. But if you&apos;re in the Fed&apos;s position, it continues to reaffirm that the wait-and-see approach remains the most prudent stance at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, all of this is outdated data as we haven&apos;t seen the impact of tariffs yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, we got some tidbits on trade but nothing that really stands out. The EU and US only look to set up a meeting in three weeks&apos; time while Trump touted a proposal by India on zero tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar remained more sluggish throughout though, continuing with the mood from yesterday. EUR/USD pushed up to a high of 1.1228 before keeping around 1.1187 currently - still up 0.1% on the day. Meanwhile, USD/JPY is continuing to track lower as it tests waters below the 146.00 mark. The low earlier touched 145.48 before keeping near the figure level again now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is holding more modest against the commodity currencies though. USD/CAD is flattish around 1.3985 while AUD/USD is down 0.3% to 0.6405 on the day. For the aussie, it&apos;s a bit of a setback after the better jobs report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-april-2025-unemployment-rate-41-vs-41-expected-employment-change-890k-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, equities are keeping more sluggish today as the upside momentum begins to run into a bit exhaustion. European indices are mostly down again, though losses are relatively light. Meanwhile, S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.4% and that comes even with Walmart earnings turning out for the better but there is a word of warning about prices there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, the bond market continues to offer something of interest with yields staying on the higher side. We&apos;re not quite breaching 5% yet on 30-year yields but it is still keeping thereabouts on the week, now seen at 4.95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Up next, we&apos;ll have a slew of US data to work through with PPI, retail sales, and the weekly jobless claims on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GBPUSD poised for another rally or first we get a deeper pullback?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD got a boost across
the board on Monday as the US-China tariff relief was a much better than
expected news. The market started to look at the more hawkish scenario where we
get an average 10% global tariff rate and economic activity picks up on an
easing in growth fears and general uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led to a hawkish
repricing in interest rates expectations with the market now seeing 50 bps of
easing for the Fed by year-end compared to like 120 bps at the peak of the
fears in April. The short dollar trade was pretty overcrowded so the unwinding
in positioning gave the greenback even more strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we repriced the interest
rates expectations, the USD started to lose ground against the major currencies
once again. We will likely need the market to price in an even less dovish path
for interest rates to give the greenback another boost. That could come from
economic data or hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the GBP side, there wasn&apos;t much change in the fundamentals but the hawks are starting to get uncomfortable by the lack of meaningful progress on inflation, especially on the wage growth side. The market is pricing in 45 bps of easing by year end, which is roughly equal to two rate cuts every quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that GBPUSD threatened a break below the key 1.32 handle on Monday, but eventually rallied back above it erasing the USD gains. If we get back to that level, we can expect the buyers to step in once again with a defined risk below it to position for a rally into new cycle highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the major upward trendline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that we have a downward trendline defining the bearish structure on this timeframe. This consolidation has also formed what looks like a bullish flag but we will need a break above the trendline to confirm that. For now, the sellers will likely continue to lean on the downward trendline to push into new lows, while the buyers will wait for a break higher to increase the bullish bets into new cycle highs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No preparations for a Putin visit in the coming days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing has been agreed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do not know yet how negotiations will go (when asked if Putin will go if Trump does)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too early to talk about what will happen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do not even know if Ukraine will show up or how talks will pan out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Putin&apos;s no-show has pretty much thrown things into disarray here. On the Ukrainian side, they&apos;re displeased that Putin is sending a more &quot;low-level&quot; delegation. It sort of undermines the intention and motivation. Well, so much for the early week drama. And so the battle rages on..&lt;/p&gt;

The PCE price index is the Fed&apos;s preferred inflation measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These forecasts can change a little after the US PPI today and the US Import prices tomorrow. It&apos;s certainly moving in the right direction, but unfortunately inflation is a lagging indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now pricing better growth ahead following the positive developments on the trade front. This is taking long term Treasury yields higher as inflationary pressures could return given that we might see a surge in economic activity as uncertainty eases.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Week 10 of EBC’s Million Dollar Trading Challenge II was
anything but ordinary. With wild market swings, leaderboard shake-ups, and a
community of traders keeping each other on their toes, this week had it all. If
you missed the action or just want the highlights, we’ve got you covered with
answers to the week’s most burning questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made Week 10 so unpredictable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 10 was a rollercoaster! Gold kicked things off with a
sharp reversal, surprising many traders and shaking up the leaderboard.
Previous frontrunner @willsdad saw profits trimmed, while @forexwatchbrother
jumped on the opportunity with some well-timed long positions. It was a classic
case of “expect the unexpected” in the markets. Did forex pairs add to the
excitement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Midweek, major forex pairs like USD/JPY and
GBP/USD brought plenty of volatility. The smartest traders knew when to hold
back-like @songqiantongzi, who stayed on the sidelines during early whipsaws
and avoided unnecessary losses. Sometimes, patience really does pay off! Were
there any big comeback stories? You bet! Thursday delivered dramatic breakouts
in both gold and the S&amp;amp;P 500. @forexwatchbrother extended their lead with
bold trades, while @willsdad made a notable comeback by capitalising on equity swings.
In the Rising Stars group, @Gaoxin’s high-conviction trades pushed returns to
new highs and attracted a growing crowd of copiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the leaderboard look by the end of the week? It was
anyone’s game! @songqiantongzi regained ground with a string of profitable
trades, while @forexwatchbrother held onto a narrow lead. The Rising Stars
category stayed fiercely competitive, with several traders posting double-digit
returns and new contenders emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was happening on the community front?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC’s zero-fee copy trading platform was buzzing! More
traders than ever were following top performers, using real-time transparency
and signal ratings to learn and adapt. The community spirit was alive and well,
making Week 10 as much about shared learning as individual wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finale is Nearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 10 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;EBC’s&lt;/a&gt;
Million Dollar Trading Challenge II was full of surprises, comebacks, and community
energy. With the finale just around the corner, traders and followers alike are
gearing up for an exciting finish. Stay tuned-the best may be yet to come!&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has been on a great ride since Trump&apos;s tariff pause announcement back on April 9. We&apos;ve seen the same with the US stock market given that the main macro drivers for both are growth expectations and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, growth expectations continue to improve but a new risk is emerging: repricing in interest rates expectations. We already saw a more hawkish repricing as the market went from expecting 120 bps of easing in 2025 to just 50 bps at the moment. That was based on improving growth expectations and easing in recessionary fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the market could start focusing back on inflation as the potential surge in demand and economic activity on an easing in uncertainty, could restrain the Fed from cutting rates more than once this year. This repricing might trigger a bigger pullback in Bitcoin and the stock market in the short-term, although the uptrend would remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the economic data is now back in focus, especially on the inflation side. Watch out also for hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that we have an upward trendline defining the bullish momentum. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the 93,000 price area.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Gold Futures Analysis Today: Key Events, Market Sentiment, and OrderFlow Intel Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2178&quot; data-end=&quot;2203&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;🚩 TRADER-UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2205&quot; data-end=&quot;2616&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gold futures (GC) strongly confirmed the bullish double-bottom scenario at 10:40, reversing the temporary bearish concern seen at 10:22. Robust Delta SL, Delta Change, and improved cumulative delta at the recent bar clearly demonstrate renewed bullish dominance. Traders holding bullish positions can confidently remain bullish, closely monitoring future bars for continued positive delta reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2618&quot; data-end=&quot;2700&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;AI-Based Order Flow Prediction Score: +6 (Bullish Bias, Strong Confidence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold futures (GC) have shown mixed performance recently. Over the last week, gold futures declined by 6.42%, reflecting weakened short-term sentiment. The one-month performance also signals caution with a 2.15% decrease. However, the broader perspective remains positive with gains of 6.74% over three months, 22.81% over six months, and a robust year-to-date (YTD) gain of 19.52%. Over the past year, gold futures have impressively increased by 33.59%, underlining its continuing appeal as a safe-haven asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Critical Economic Events (May 15, 2025):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several significant events today will likely influence gold price movements, particularly due to their impact on safe-haven sentiment and investor confidence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Producer Price Index (PPI): 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Retail Sales: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Unemployment Claims: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Empire State Manufacturing Index: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Philly Fed Manufacturing Index: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Housing Starts &amp;amp; Building Permits: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Trade Price Indices: 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Industrial Production &amp;amp; Capacity Utilization: 9:15 AM EDT (4:15 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Business Inventories: 10:00 AM EDT (5:00 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;U. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment: 10:00 AM EDT (5:00 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&apos;s Speech: 12:40 PM GMT (3:40 PM EEST)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These economic indicators are closely monitored by investors as they directly influence market perceptions of economic stability, inflationary pressures, and the potential direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Specifically, the speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be highly scrutinized for insights on interest rate trends, economic outlook, and inflation management, which are key drivers for gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current GC Price: 3161&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How OrderFlow Intel Enhances Your Trading Decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our AI-based methodology utilizes specialized Order Flow data, tracking actual buyer and seller behaviors in real-time. Unlike traditional price charts alone, Order Flow analysis monitors buying and selling pressure, providing deeper insights into market sentiment and helping identify potential turning points like reversals or breakouts earlier and more reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Does OrderFlow Data Matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OrderFlow data offers transparency into market activities at critical price levels. By analyzing the intensity and volume of buying versus selling, traders gain valuable clues about whether buyers or sellers are taking control. This helps in precisely identifying reversals, consolidations, or continuation scenarios, greatly improving decision-making accuracy and timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Analysis &amp;amp; Findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our OrderFlow Intel recently identified a clear bullish reversal in Gold Futures (GC), initially confirmed by buyer strength at a key support level around 09:54 (approximate bar timing). After experiencing a brief bearish resistance near the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), buyers stepped back strongly at around 10:40, reinforcing bullish momentum. This recent action implies buyers have regained control and are likely positioning for further upward movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Levels Traders Should Watch Closely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value Area Low (VAL): 3131.6 – acts as key support; strong bullish signals here can indicate reliable entry points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point of Control (POC): 3150 – the price level with the highest traded volume, critical for identifying areas of strong market interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): 3155.4 – commonly used by institutions; a crucial level for intraday market sentiment and direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value Area High (VAH): 3163 – serves as immediate resistance; breaking and holding above it suggests continued bullish strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actionable Gold Trader Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders using OrderFlow Intel should consider bullish positions if GC maintains above today&apos;s VWAP (3155.4) and confidently breaks above the Value Area High (3163), signaling bullish continuation. Stops should be strategically placed below key levels such as the Point of Control (3150) or Value Area Low (3131.6) to protect against unexpected bearish reversals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion for Gold Traders Now (and Today):
OrderFlow Intel&apos;s analysis strongly supports a current bullish scenario in Gold Futures, provided price maintains its momentum above identified key levels. Traders should leverage these insights and key market levels for timely and well-managed trade entries and risk control.&lt;/p&gt;

All of this of course is before we see any impact from tariffs. So, it&apos;s pretty much outdated data.&lt;/p&gt;

The breakdown shows it comes amid a jump in capital goods in particular. The rise there (+3.2%) was accompanied by increases in output for durable consumer goods (+3.1%) and also intermediate goods (+0.6%). That was slightly offset by a fall in energy output (-0.5%) on the month.&lt;/p&gt;

Adding to that is a further increase in supply as OPEC+ steps up production further. Not quite the positive outlook for the oil market as such. But at least looking to next year, IEA sees some better prospects compared to the month before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDJPY Technical Analysis – We filled the Monday gap</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD got a boost across
the board on Monday as the US-China tariff relief was a much better than
expected news. The market started to look at the more hawkish scenario where we
get an average 10% global tariff rate and economic activity picks up on an
easing in growth fears and general uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led to a hawkish
repricing in interest rates expectations with the market now seeing 50 bps of
easing for the Fed by year-end compared to like 120 bps at the peak of the
fears in April. The short dollar trade was pretty overcrowded so the unwinding
in positioning gave the greenback even more strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we repriced the interest
rates expectations, the USD started to lose ground against the major currencies
once again. We will likely need the market to price in an even less dovish path
for interest rates to give the greenback another boost. That could come from
economic data or hawkish Fed comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it’s been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent positive mood in
the markets weighed on the Japanese Yen which lost ground against all the major
currencies despite the market increasing the expectations for another rate hike
this year. We got a rally in the JPY yesterday although there was no clear
catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY fell back below the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; in what could end up being a
fakeout. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk
to reward setup around the upward trendline to position for a rally into the
151.00 handle, while the sellers will look for a break lower to increase the
bearish bets into the 140.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that the price is now filling the Monday gap which could act as support.
This is where we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the
gap to position for a rally into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand,
will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the upward trendline
next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on this
timeframe. The sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to push
into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break higher to increase the
bullish bets into the 151.00 handle next. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures, the US
PPI and the US Retail Sales data. We will also hear from Fed Chair Powell, so
it’s worth to keep an eye on that in case he delivers some market moving
comments. Tomorrow, we conclude the week with the Japanese Q1 GDP report and
the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We expect that the negotiations will lead to a good result&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But would like to make it clear that we are prepared to act if talks do not succeed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So far, it&apos;s been very slow-going in terms of any progress between the EU and US. Well, to be fair the only countries that are making real progress are the US&apos; closer allies i.e. UK, Japan, India, South Korea. If you think about it, it is a slap in the face to everyone else that China also got the same 10% baseline treatment after all the retaliation by only deciding to sit down and talk. Meanwhile, everyone else had no choice but to get that shoved down their throat even by trying to reconcile instead of retaliating.&lt;/p&gt;
