While some investors argue structural headwinds could undermine the dollar, the bank sees these risks as overstated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;440&quot; data-end=&quot;455&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;457&quot; data-end=&quot;1204&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;457&quot; data-end=&quot;693&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;459&quot; data-end=&quot;574&quot;&gt;Near-Term Recovery Drivers: Credit Agricole sees a likely US growth rebound in late 2025 and 2026 due to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-start=&quot;577&quot; data-end=&quot;693&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;577&quot; data-end=&quot;623&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;580&quot; data-end=&quot;623&quot;&gt;Extension of personal income tax cuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;626&quot; data-end=&quot;656&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;629&quot; data-end=&quot;656&quot;&gt;Easing trade tensions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;659&quot; data-end=&quot;693&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;662&quot; data-end=&quot;693&quot;&gt;Looser financial conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;695&quot; data-end=&quot;803&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;697&quot; data-end=&quot;803&quot;&gt;Fed Outlook: Persistent inflation could limit the scope of rate cuts, supporting USD carry appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;805&quot; data-end=&quot;1026&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;807&quot; data-end=&quot;1026&quot;&gt;Skepticism on De-Dollarization: While some investors cite Trump’s weak dollar bias and the risk of a “Mar-a-Lago accord” as threats, Credit Agricole sees no credible alternative to the USD as a reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1028&quot; data-end=&quot;1204&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1030&quot; data-end=&quot;1204&quot;&gt;US Policy Messaging: Treasury Secretary Bessent has emphasized a strong USD, and Trump has backed off attacks on Fed independence, both viewed as stabilizing signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1206&quot; data-end=&quot;1505&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1206&quot; data-end=&quot;1505&quot;&gt;Despite ongoing debate around structural risks to the dollar, Credit Agricole sees fundamental strength and policy dynamics as supportive.

                            &lt;p&gt;Polls have shown that Greenlanders are dead-against joining the USA but the Trump administration is looking to find another way to pull the island closer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us-weighs-special-status-greenland-quest-island-intensifies-2025-05-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to a Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While the precise details of COFA agreements - which have only ever been
 extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall 
Islands and Palau - vary depending on the signatory, the U.S. government
 typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to 
emergency management to military protection. In exchange, the U.S. 
military operates freely in COFA countries and trade with the U.S. is 
largely duty-free.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said Greenland would need to separate from Denmark for the plan to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;145&quot; data-end=&quot;423&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, AUDUSD broke above a key swing area and the upper boundary of a consolidation range dating back to April 15, moving as high as 0.65135. The bullish breakout included a move above the 200-day moving average at 0.64587, signaling strong buying interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;425&quot; data-end=&quot;622&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, momentum faded. Following the Fed rate decision on Wednesday, the pair fell back below the 200-day MA, and on Thursday, a corrective rally stalled right at that key MA level as sellers leaned in and stalled the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;624&quot; data-end=&quot;860&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In today’s Asian session, buyers stepped in at a rising trendline support, helping to lift the pair back above the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart. But gains were capped once again near the 200-hour MA at 0.64291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking ahead, AUDUSD faces a cluster of resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;917&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-hour MA: 0.64291&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;944&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;946&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;100-hour MA: 0.64459&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;973&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;975&quot; data-end=&quot;1000&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-day MA: 0.64588&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1001&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1044&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Swing area (red box): 0.6429–0.6442&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1046&quot; data-end=&quot;1309&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite recent pullbacks, the pair remains closer to the highs for the year. Holding above the trendline and 4-hour 100-bar MA is constructive, but buyers need to reclaim and sustain a move above the 200-day MA to regain full control and build bullish confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) 🚨 BITCOIN FORECAST: $130K THIS YEAR, UP TO $2.4M BY 2030?

Kalshi traders see Bitcoin peaking at $130K in 2024.

Cathie Wood&apos;s Ark Invest just revised their 2030 forecasts:
🔸 Bull Case: $2.4M/coin — up from $1.5M, assuming tighter “active” supply and strong institutional adoption
🔸 Base Case: $1.2M/coin — up from $710K, driven by Bitcoin as “digital gold” and ETF-driven demand
🔸 Bear Case: $500K/coin — slightly above the prior $300K–$500K range, factoring in volatility and adoption risks

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NZDUSD attempted a downside break today, falling below key swing support and the 200-day moving average 0.58836, but after reaching a low of 0.5869, the price quickly rebounded, disappointing the sellers.  The price  is now showing signs of stabilization with the buyers pushing back higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers had their shot below 0..5883 to 0.58927. They missed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;483&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this week (Wednesday), the pair moved to a high near the April highs at 0.60281 (the high reached 0.6022), suggesting strong resistance remains at the upper boundary of the consolidation range. So buyers had their shot as well, but they failed to extend higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;483&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In between the support at 0.58836 and the resistance at 0.6028, is a cluster of moving averages (100-hour, 200-hour, and 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart) around 0.5945–0.5955 now sits near the middle of the recent range and represents a key barrier for buyers on any rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;830&quot; data-end=&quot;1039&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, price action remains trapped between resistance near 0.6018 and support around 0.5886. A break outside this range—particularly with momentum—will be needed to define the next directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1041&quot; data-end=&quot;1065&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1066&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1066&quot; data-end=&quot;1112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1068&quot; data-end=&quot;1112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5886–0.5893 (200-day MA zone)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1113&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1115&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.5950–0.5965 (MA cluster), then 0.6018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1171&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1263&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bearish confirmation: Sustained break below 0.5886 opens room toward 0.5820 and 0.5771&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Amritsar is a city of 1.4 million in the north of the country close to Pakistan. Reuters reports hearing four blasts in the city in a sign of the escalating conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold prices are up $37 to $3342 today in what&apos;s been a very volatile week for the precious metal.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It looks like negotiations to end the Ukraine war are slowly falling apart but that could be an illusion as negotiations are always the toughest at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a different tone than we heard from Powell. Bostic has been a hawk but he&apos;s shifting here, evidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s not prudent to adjust policy amid uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll keep an eye out for more headlines. The US dollar is rebounding after an earlier dip.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD is extending higher as dollar selling gathers momentum.  Stocks are lower with the S&amp;amp;P and Nasdaq indices now down -0.10%.  The US yields are lower with the 10-year now down -2.0 basis points. The 2 year is down -5.0 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;79&quot; data-end=&quot;599&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD broke below a consolidation zone between 1.3232 and 1.3241 earlier today, after holding that area as support in yesterday’s trade. The downside momentum carried the pair toward a key swing area between 1.32017 and 1.32067—a zone that acted as resistance and later support during the first half of April. Notably, the price based near that level on April 17 before launching a rally that reached the 2024 high at 1.3433, and briefly extended to the cycle high of 1.34413—the highest since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since that peak, price action has been volatile and rangebound. Today&apos;s downside break was significant, but lacked follow-through selling, and buyers have since stepped back in, pushing the pair higher. The rebound is now testing the 100-hour moving average at 1.33078 and the 200-hour moving average at 1.33168—key intraday resistance levels that will help determine whether buyers can regain short-term control (see blue and green lines on the chart above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The moving average levels are midrange barometers or more bullish more bearish. Admittedly, earlier this week, the price traded above and below the moving averages – especially during yesterday&apos;s volatile up and down trading. Nevertheless, a move above would be a tilt more in the bullish direction from a technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;601&quot; data-end=&quot;993&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, find willing sellers here, and the price remains in the bottom portion of the range.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market today presents a mixed tableau of sector performances, with electric vehicles taking center stage. Tesla (TSLA) leads the charge in the auto manufacturer space with a robust gain of 6.40%. This significant upswing is indicative of bullish sentiment surrounding the company, possibly fueled by positive sales figures or advancements in battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology: Overall, the tech sector is experiencing a subdued day. Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants show slight declines, while Oracle (ORCL) manages a small gain of 0.27%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semiconductors: The sector faces challenges, with Nvidia (NVDA) seeing a decline of 0.92%. This drop points toward continued caution among investors in the semiconductor landscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: It&apos;s a mixed bag today, with AbbVie (ABBV) rising by 1.78%, showcasing its stability amidst volatile market dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical: Amazon (AMZN) remains stable with a modest increase of 0.12%, reinforcing its resilience in the consumer market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financials: Visa (V) edges up by 0.18%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 0.10%, reflecting tepid optimism in financial services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market sentiment today appears to be one of cautious optimism. The positive performance by Tesla highlights growing investor confidence in sustainable energy and transportation alternatives. However, the broader mixed signals, especially in tech and healthcare, indicate investor apprehension toward potential disruptions or policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in major tech companies like Google (GOOG) at -0.81% further underscores the tentative market attitude toward the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investors, it may be prudent to consider rebalancing portfolios to include more exposure to the electric vehicle sector and related sustainable energy investments. Tesla’s surge suggests momentum that could yield favorable returns. Adopting a diversified strategy might safeguard against the volatility observed in tech and healthcare stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, staying informed on semiconductor trends is essential, given the ongoing fluctuations. Investors might explore opportunities outside of traditional tech, particularly in sectors showing sustainability growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, investors are urged to keep an eye on real-time data and market analyses for timely adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is it taboo to talk about shipping fraud?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The funny thing about wonk economists is that they rarely look past the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 145% tariffs on China (or today&apos;s Trump-floated number of 80%), they crunch the numbers and trade with China essentially stops. They run that through their models and that spits out assumptions around economic growth and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same thing when everyone announced sanctions on Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened in reality? Cheating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still get anything you want in Russia as the goods are simply shipped through a Russia-friendly country that then re-exports them. Otherwise, local officials turn a blind eye to where their own companies are shipping: After all, cutting exports means cutting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on today&apos;s Chinese trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-january-april-yuan-denominated-exports-75-yy-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, it hasn&apos;t taken long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese exports to the US in today&apos;s trade report fell 21% but rose by an equal percentage with south-east Asian nations and the EU. The largest increases were with Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/how-did-us-tariffs-impact-chinas-latest-trade-numbers-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; this earlier and has been way ahead on this angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone is up-in-arms about the trade war the reality might be far more benign: The labels are changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect that the greatest bull market in the world right now is importing Chinese goods, changing the labels and re-exporting to the US. It&apos;s in almost everyone&apos;s best interest to look the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think this is all taboo to talk about in economic circles, maybe it should remain that way. Just no one tell Trump and the global economy can continue to hum along.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, the imbalance is much smaller when excluding gold and gold trade is something that Trump referred to yesterday in the UK deal.&lt;/p&gt;

Staying below it will keep sellers in control in the short term and validate the downside break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;754&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier today, the pair found support at a swing area that traces back to 2024 (not shown on the chart) between 1.12007 and 1.1213, and the bounce higher is currently testing broken support turned resistance. If sellers can defend this resistance ceiling zone and push back lower through 1.1200, the next major target comes into view at the 50% retracement level near 1.1145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;771&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;772&quot; data-end=&quot;944&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;772&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;774&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance (broken support): 1.1265–1.1275&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;821&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;823&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next downside target: 1.1200 to 1.1213 (swing area from 2024)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;821&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;823&quot; data-end=&quot;873&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Short-term control: Bears remain in charge below the 1.1265-75. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;946&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back above the former floor would weaken the bearish bias and open the door for a further rebound.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;181&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;USDCHF remains confined within a well-defined trading range after failed breakout attempts on both sides of a trading range going back April 23rd this week. On Wednesday, the pair dipped below the range floor at 0.8195, reaching a low of 0.8185, but momentum quickly faded and the move was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;753&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the price pushed above the top of the box at 0.8333 and reached a high of 0.83405. However, that too failed to hold, falling just short of the key 38.2% retracement level at 0.83505. The inability to sustain momentum outside the range suggests indecision and a lack of directional conviction from traders. Ultimately if the price is to gain more momentum, getting about the 38.2% retracement is a minimum retracement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;755&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the red box range between 0.8195 and 0.8333 continues to define the battle lines. A convincing break and close outside either boundary—supported by momentum—will be needed to tilt the bias more clearly in favor of buyers or sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;755&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In between the extremes of the red box at the converged 100 and 200 hour moving averages at 0.8253. There might be some support ahead of that between 0.8272 and 0.8280. With a price now trading at new laws, those levels become downside targets and risk/bias defining levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;998&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1014&quot; data-end=&quot;1240&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1014&quot; data-end=&quot;1106&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1016&quot; data-end=&quot;1106&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Range resistance: 0.8333 (failed breakout high: 0.83405, next target: 0.83505 – 38.2%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1107&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1109&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Range support: 0.8195 (failed breakout low: 0.8185)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1240&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1240&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neutral zone: Within the box; moving averages clustered near midpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US stocks are set to open higher. Shares of banking on trade deals to come. US and China will meet in Switzerland. Pres. Trump said that 80% tariff seems about right (down from 145%). Realistically, 80% is still too high and will likely lead to higher inflation and higher unemployment as small businesses go out of business. Uncertainty remains high but hope springs eternal.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The futures are implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow up 112 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index up 21 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ up 95 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming into the day, the S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indexes are modestly lower: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -0.40%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -0.28%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, both the S&amp;amp;P and the NASDAQ indices are staying above their 50 day moving average at session lows this week. Looking at the S&amp;amp;P index the 50 day moving averages at 5555.65 (lots of 5&apos;s).  On the top side, the 200 day moving average is the next target at 5747.76)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Dow industrial average, the index is up 0.12% coming into the final day of the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In premarket trading: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nvidia shares are trading up 0.34%. The price is up 2.51% for the trading week (at the close yesterday. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alphabet shares are down -0.34%. For the week, they are down -5.94%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft shares are up 0.36% for the day. For the week the index is up 0.66%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta shares are up 1.01% in premarket trading. For the week into today, the shares are up 0.16%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple shares are up 0.66%, but for the week the shares are down -3.83%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon shares are up 0.53% in premarket trading, and are up 1.11% for the week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla heirs are up 1.82% in premarket trading. At the close yesterday, the shares were down -0.83%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Canada’s April 2025 jobs report showed a modest employment gain of 7.4K, beating the 2.5K forecast but coming off a sharp decline of 32.6K the prior month. The headline unemployment rate rose to 6.9%—above the 6.8% expected and the highest since 2021—partly due to a slight rise in labor force participation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-time employment rebounded with a gain of 31.5K, but part-time jobs fell by 24.2K. Manufacturing employment dropped by 31K, and average hourly wages for permanent employees held steady at 3.5% year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the uptick in full-time work was encouraging, the report was weighed down by a rise in joblessness and a 37K temporary election-related hiring boost that is expected to reverse in May. Overall, the report was mixed with a slightly negative tilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;71&quot; data-end=&quot;394&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tthe USDCAD has seen little price action since the report.  Technicallly, the pair continues its upward push after failing to gain downside momentum earlier this week. The pair has broken through prior resistance at 1.38917–1.3904, turning that area into support. Holding above this new floor is crucial to maintain the bullish bias. A move back below would be a near-term disappointment for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next key challenge lies in the 1.3924–1.3933 swing area. Earlier today, the price did move above that area, but could not sustain the bullish momentum. To keep the momentum going, the price must not only break above this zone but also hold above it. They 38.2% retracement of the move down from the April high remains as a target that needs to be broken to show the buyers are taking back more control. The 200 day moving average is also near that level just above the 1.4000 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;622&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If bulls succeed, the next targets on the topside come in at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;623&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;623&quot; data-end=&quot;663&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;625&quot; data-end=&quot;663&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3977 – swing high from mid-April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;664&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;666&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.4000 zone – where the 38.2% retracement of the broader move down and the 200-day moving average converge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;778&quot; data-end=&quot;975&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With rising support and fading downside momentum, the path of least resistance currently leans higher, but follow-through above the 1.3933 level is essential to open the door for the 1.4000 target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;992&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;993&quot; data-end=&quot;1147&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;993&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;995&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38917–1.3904 (prior ceiling, now a floor). Move below would disappoint buyers looking for more upside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1105&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1105&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3924–1.3933 (must break and hold)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1106&quot; data-end=&quot;1147&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1108&quot; data-end=&quot;1147&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Upside targets: 1.3977, then 1.4000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expect growth to slow considerably, inflation and unemployment higher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are focused on keeping inflation as close to target as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key to think in scenarios in times of uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Factors keeping the long-run neutral rate low are still in place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still see the long-run neutral rate as quite low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The markets are very focused on downside risks at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markets appear convinced Fed will get inflation back to 2%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now is an inflection point between hard and soft data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard data is telling us the economy is good right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The next few quarters will help illuminate economy&apos;s state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed desk is also responsible to gathering &quot;market intelligence&quot; besides executing the FOMC policy. The part where he says that the markets are very focused on downside risks at the moment is likely coming from such market intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not something new of course, but the rally in the stock market of the past weeks was based on optimism, and most of that optimism is now priced in. So, there are risks of disappointment ahead and there&apos;s no room for complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

Bias: Range-bound, with key reversal levels to monitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;250&quot; data-end=&quot;524&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s session is shaped by caution ahead of this weekend’s expected developments in U.S.–China trade negotiations. With uncertainty in the air and Friday’s typical low-volatility tone, the Nasdaq futures are likely to remain range-bound unless there’s a surprise breakout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;526&quot; data-end=&quot;568&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trade Compass Range and Key Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;570&quot; data-end=&quot;625&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We identify a central equilibrium zone forming between:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;626&quot; data-end=&quot;752&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;626&quot; data-end=&quot;667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;628&quot; data-end=&quot;667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Developing VWAP (Today): 20,181.5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;668&quot; data-end=&quot;695&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;670&quot; data-end=&quot;695&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;POC (May 2): 20,212&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;696&quot; data-end=&quot;752&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;698&quot; data-end=&quot;752&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s VWAP: Close to today’s developing VWAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;754&quot; data-end=&quot;841&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This tight clustering suggests 20,180–20,210 is the market’s current “fair value” area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;848&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Topside Reversal Zone (Short Opportunity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;900&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;900&quot; data-end=&quot;959&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;902&quot; data-end=&quot;959&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Threshold: 20,326 (Yesterday’s Value Area High)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;960&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;962&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additional Confluence: 20,300 (POC and round number)
Plan: Look for signs of bearish reversal if price reaches this area.
Breakout Confirmation: Two consecutive 30-minute closes above 20,326 = bullish surprise
Upside Target on Breakout: 20,570&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1246&quot; data-end=&quot;1297&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Downside Reversal Zone (Long Opportunity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1298&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1298&quot; data-end=&quot;1385&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1300&quot; data-end=&quot;1326&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Support Cluster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1329&quot; data-end=&quot;1385&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1329&quot; data-end=&quot;1356&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1331&quot; data-end=&quot;1356&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;20,075 (VWAP May 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1359&quot; data-end=&quot;1385&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1361&quot; data-end=&quot;1385&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;20,060 (POC May 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1386&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1388&quot; data-end=&quot;1424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lower Threshold for Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1427&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1427&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1429&quot; data-end=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;20,027 (VAH May 1)
Plan: Watch for bullish reversal in this zone.
Breakdown Confirmation: Two consecutive 30-minute closes below 20,025 = bearish surprise
Downside Target on Breakdown: 19,855 (Just above POC May 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1684&quot; data-end=&quot;1709&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Summary Outlook for Nasdaq Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1710&quot; data-end=&quot;1991&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Expect range-bound behavior unless triggered by surprise headlines or breakout volume. Today’s structure favors mean reversion within the defined bounds, not trend continuation. Both bulls and bears are likely to treat outer levels as inflection points for reversal trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1998&quot; data-end=&quot;2043&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reminder for Nasdaq Traders and Investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2044&quot; data-end=&quot;2193&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;tradeCompass offers a map, not a bias. Use the thresholds and key levels to adjust your strategy in real-time. Only act on breakouts once confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2195&quot; data-end=&quot;2415&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stay alert and trade at your own risk.
