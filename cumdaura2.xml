Trump today.  I wonder what his mood will be on the first visit since it being elected?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Where are the US red lines on trade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the big question that needs an answer for me to have any kind of conviction in the macro outlook. Yesterday Kyodo &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/05/7f50bb4801c0-update1-us-rejects-japans-exemption-from-reciprocal-tariffs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Japan&apos;s 
top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa in their meeting in Washington last week 
that the administration of President Donald Trump intends to put only a 
cut in the 14 percent country-specific tariff, suspended through early 
July, on the negotiating table, the sources said&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a big problem for Japan and the rest of the world. If the US is putting a floor on 10% tariffs then we&apos;re in for a bruising trade war. I just can&apos;t see many countries conceding anything if the US isn&apos;t aiming for free trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I fear that Trump wants these negotiations to fail so he can put on tariffs. Maybe that sets up a showdown with Congress that restores order but that&apos;s a hard bet to make at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we get US and Canadian trade balance numbers today for March. At 11:30 pm ET, Carney will arrive to meet Trump and the pair will have a meeting 15 minutes later and then lunch at 12:15 pm ET. It&apos;s not clear when they will address the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the trade data, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to be a market mover.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is moving lower vs. the major currencies. The FOMC rate decision is still one day away where they market traders will be interested in what the Fed has to say about future policy action. For today what technical levels are being broken from the USD selling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD:
Sellers emerged early in the Asian session, but once again, buyers stepped in near 1.1273—a key support level on the daily chart. The repeated defense of this level pushed the pair higher, but gains stalled near the 200-hour moving average at 1.13469. That moving average has capped rallies over the past two days, each time leading to a reversal. Today, sellers appear more cautious. A sustained move above the 200-hour moving average would shift the technical bias more firmly to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY:
Last Friday, USDJPY tested the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, where sellers stepped in and drove the pair lower. In today’s session, the price first broke below the 200-hour moving average and then found temporary support at the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart near 142.86. However, sellers have since pushed the price below that level as the U.S. session gets underway. Holding below the 100-bar moving average would open the door toward the next downside target in the 141.64–142.11 swing area. On the flip side, a failure to stay below could lead to a rebound toward the 200-hour moving average at 143.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD:
GBPUSD is pushing higher today after breaking above the 100-hour moving average at 1.3302, followed by the 200-hour moving average at 1.3326. The bullish momentum has taken the pair into a key resistance zone between 1.3362 and 1.3378. The current price is trading within that swing area. A break above would open the door toward the upper extreme for the year, between 1.3378 and 1.3441. This resistance zone marks a critical test as the U.S. session begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;65&quot; data-end=&quot;260&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Germany, political uncertainty as the first parliamentary vote to confirm PM Merz as Chancellor fell short of the required majority, receiving 310 votes versus the 316 needed. A second vote is scheduled for 14:00 BST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;262&quot; data-end=&quot;545&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In North America, trade data for March is due today. The U.S. is expected to post a substantial trade deficit of $137 billion, widening from $122.7 billion in February. Canada is also forecast to report a slightly larger deficit of $1.56 billion compared to $1.52 billion previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;547&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At 10:00 AM ET, Canada’s Ivey PMI will be released, with the prior seasonally adjusted figure at 51.3. The index tends to be volatile and usually doesn’t spark significant market reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;738&quot; data-end=&quot;883&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At 1:00 PM ET, the U.S. Treasury will auction 10-year notes. Yesterday’s 3-year note auction saw solid demand, particularly from domestic buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;1062&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In FX sentiment, a Reuters poll shows growing concern about the U.S. dollar’s safe-haven status: 46 of 83 strategists expressed concern, up from 19 of 51 in the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other data, the major US stock indices are trading lower according to the futures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -257 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -43 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -205 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the S&amp;amp;P snapped its nine-day win streak with a decline out minus 36.29 points or -0.64%. The NASDAQ index fell -0.74%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are mixed ahead of the 10 year auction at 1 PM ET:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.807%, -3.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.928%, -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.341%, -0.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.840%, +1.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Chris Lunday, a reporter for Politico, is saying that the Bundestag will hold a second Merz vote today at 15:15 Berlin time. He adds &quot;all factions have been summoned and full attendence is expected. This is the make or break moment for Merz.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to his post on X &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/lundayfunday/status/1919724041994125772&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

further&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have been a pretty boring session in terms of data and news releases if it wasn&apos;t for German politics. Merz fell short of majority needed to become German chancellor in the first voting round. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He needed 316 votes to win a majority but didn&apos;t manage to reach that 
(only got 310 votes) even though the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition has 328 MPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAX reacted by selling off but eventually bottomed and started to recover the losses as AfD backed a new vote as early as Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another notable news was the Chinese State Council Information Office reporting that Chinese officials 
including the PBoC would hold a press conference tomorrow on financial 
policy package to stabilise market and expectations. Chinese stocks rallied on the news as expectations for a proper stimulus started to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus now switches to Trump-Carney meeting due at 11:45 ET/15:45 GMT and potential trade related headlines.

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomber is reporting the news. This is likely an algo driven reaction to the headline but it&apos;s not something new. The EU has been threatening retaliation in case trade negotiations were to fail for a long time. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the moves get faded shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/eu-targets-100-billion-of-us-goods-with-tariffs-if-talks-fail?taid=6819f2c48745050001eb2137&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the full article&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a nice day for DAX traders as political volatility provided some nice opportunities. Below you can see the 5 minute chart of the DAX where I marked the two main headlines that triggered the biggest moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a great example for new traders on being open minded and nimble when conditions change. The fear of political instability triggered by the failure of the first voting round sent the DAX lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we started to get more and more news of support for a second round as soon as tomorrow, the fears started to ease and the dip-buyers started to pile in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s critical for a trader to be open minded and not get attached to his/her own bias when conditions change. If you took a trade because of X and something invalidates the original reason, just get out. This will not save you money in the long term, but might also improve your performance if you can also take the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We feel the market has returned to a more stable situation today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expectations of the Taiwanese dollar appreciating have mostly gone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/TWD has been more well behaved today after all the warnings since yesterday. But when you have officials put in place and scrutinising every move, that sort of helps I guess. This calls for a bit of storytelling time..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;When central banks act this way, it&apos;s usually a case of damage control and trying to cook something up to appease the media/public. I&apos;m not saying that is what is happening with Taiwan but there are cases around the world where these things do happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In my own experience, it was all the way back in 2016 when Trump pulled off a surprise to win the US election at the time. The dollar surged strongly against emerging market currencies and things really took off. I was on the trading floor and things turned quite chaotic in just a span of two to three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In just three sessions, we already saw the local currency depreciate by over 7% by the end of day close. And when we got to office early the next morning, the offshore market i.e. non-deliverable forwards were indicating a gap open with the currency set to fall by another 13% overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;An hour before the market opens, the central bank calls us and all the other banks up and tells us that we aren&apos;t allowed to quote or do any trades until further notice. We&apos;re also not allowed to perform any deals for/with clients. And they said they will be sending an officer to each bank as they think of a way to manage the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For a good six hours, we had zero trades in the local market and zero transactions with clients. All incoming calls were just deflected by a case of &quot;system issue&quot;. Clients were of course mad but they sort of understood - at least the bigger corporates - when every single bank was refusing to offer a quote, even an indicative one. We weren&apos;t even allowed to say anything about where the offshore market was trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If any trader or dealer made a quote in the market or to their clients, he/she was fired on the spot and placed &quot;under investigation&quot;. Not a joke by the way. It didn&apos;t happen with my bank but it did happen to a friend of a friend unfortunately. And he never came back to work on the trading floor after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I remember that lunch time, I stepped out and called my parents to just change whatever you can out of the local currency. It felt like that moment in the movie The Big Short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So after six hours, we were told to quote everything at the previous day closing price. Mind you, this was some 15-20% away what the offshore market was still trading. We settled our transactions and come end of day, we were told that whatever positions we have at the end of the day will be squared directly with the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, the offshore market i.e. NDFs would not be recognised anymore and starting from the next day, all incoming foreign funds into the country will be forcefully converted into the local currency at a 75% notional amount minimum. This continued for quite a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had clients with existing forward contracts and long-term FX contracts that had to be unwound because of these forced conversions. The central bank did not entertain any appeals for that and those clients lost millions on swaps. But in the end, it was a case of trying to control the narrative and put up a facade that the &quot;market&quot; was still working. On paper, it sort of looked like it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But even after nine years now, I always believe that the damage has already been done. If not through one way, then at least surely another. At one point, the local currency was even threatened to be kicked out of the MSCI basket. There was a lame workaround to circumvent that in the end though, something to do with extending trading hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But every time I look at the screen, all I can think of is this story. And when I look at the exchange rate itself, I know deep down that it doesn&apos;t fully reflect how fundamentally flawed the currency really is. If this were a free-floating exchange rate system, things would&apos;ve looked so, so much different. But alas, it was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So yeah, that&apos;s my story for today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Should You Look for in a Reliable, Secure Offshore Account?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Offshore Account Security: Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is transparency important in offshore accounts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency is essential because it allows traders to fully
understand where their account is regulated, how their funds are handled, and
what protections are in place. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot;&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;,
we clearly inform clients about the regulatory jurisdiction of each account,
whether it is FCA-cleared or offshore-regulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This openness empowers traders to make informed decisions
and avoid the risks associated with unregulated or opaque platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What regulatory credentials should you look for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evaluating an offshore account, always look for
platforms regulated by top-tier authorities. EBC holds licences from the FCA
(UK), ASIC (Australia), and CIMA (Cayman Islands). These regulators enforce
strict standards for fund segregation, client protection, and operational
transparency. Choosing a platform with multiple reputable licenses ensure your
trading environment is secure and your interests are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are client funds protected at EBC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC safeguards client funds by holding them in segregated
accounts with trusted custodians such as Barclays UK. This means your money is
kept separate from the platform’s operating funds, so even if EBC faces
financial difficulties, your capital remains protected. We never mix client and
operational funds, ensuring the highest level of fund security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What risk management features matter most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective risk management is crucial, especially with the
higher leverage available in offshore accounts. EBC provides a comprehensive
suite of tools, including stop-loss orders, negative balance protection, margin
alerts, and flexible leverage settings. These features help you control your
exposure, prevent excessive losses, and adapt your strategy to changing market
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What trading tools and user experience does EBC offer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC’s platform is designed for both novice and experienced
traders, offering advanced charting, fast execution, and robust analytical
tools. Our user-friendly interface and technology ensure you can manage trades

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The problem with a secret ballot is that it is as the name implies, a secret. That means as things stand, Merz wouldn&apos;t even know who he has to talk to in order to turn the votes around unless those who opposed owns up to it. And let&apos;s face it, that never happens in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If they just go in blindly and he loses again, it would be extremely damaging to his and the coalition&apos;s position and credibility. The risk outweighs the reward in this case. As such, it would be prudent to hold it off for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, a second vote can be called within the next 14 days now but the same ruling applies i.e. an absolute majority of 316 votes is needed to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If the second round of voting fails again, then a third round of voting must take place immediately. For that, only a relative majority i.e. candidate with the most votes, is needed to be elected as chancellor. But in this case, the president has the authority to not appoint said person to be chancellor and dissolve the Bundestag instead as an option.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final Services PMI 49.0 vs 48.9 preliminary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 52.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final Composite PMI 48.5 vs 48.2 preliminary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 51.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Renewed downturn in new work weighs on service
sector output
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fastest decline in export sales since February 2021
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business activity expectations slump to a two-and-
a-half year low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;UK service sector output slipped into contraction for
the first time in one-and-a-half years as heightened
business uncertainty weighed on order books during
April. Export conditions were particularly weak, with new
business from abroad falling to the greatest extent since
February 2021.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Survey respondents often commented on the impact
of global financial market turbulence in the wake of US
tariff announcements. Businesses in the technology and
financial service sectors noted rising risk aversion and
delayed spending decisions among clients, especially in
relation to major investment plans. Consumer service
providers meanwhile cited subdued domestic economic
conditions and challenges with passing on rising payroll
costs, especially those in the hospitality and leisure
sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Input prices increased at the steepest pace since the
summer of 2023 as higher National Living Wage rates and
National Insurance contributions added to payroll costs
in April. Prices charged inflation was also the strongest
for nearly two years as service providers sought to pass
on additional costs to clients despite fragile demand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Business expectations for the year ahead fell sharply
as service sector firms braced for an extended period of
global economic turbulence and heightened recession
risks. Some 22% of the survey panel predict an outright
decline in business activity during the next 12 months, up
from 14% in March and well above the post-election low
of 6% in July 2024.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

We&apos;ve been getting such comments since April 2. Of course, the lack of real progress in trade talks could unnerve the market at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It was supposed to be a straightforward appointment for Friedrich Merz to be German chancellor today. But when push comes to shove, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/merz-falls-short-of-majority-needed-to-become-german-chancellor-in-first-voting-round-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;it turned out to be anything but that&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s a big and embarrassing setback for Merz and his coalition, who by the way commands 328 votes in the Bundestag, yet he only managed to secure 310 votes today. He needed 316 votes to secure a majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;re now in a bit of an unprecedented situation in German politics. No candidate for chancellor has ever failed in the first round of voting. However, the constitution does allow up to 14 days for a new round of voting. But will we see another vote today? Or tomorrow? Nobody knows for sure. But the worry here is that the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition may already be damaged before it even begins governing.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, that didn&apos;t go according to plan. The expectation was that Merz would&apos;ve been elected upon the first round of voting and then the Bundestag session will be adjourned as he travels to meet with the German president to formalise his appointment. Now, all of that is put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;He needed 316 votes to win a majority but didn&apos;t manage to reach that (only got 310 votes) even though the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition has 328 MPs. There can be a second or third round of voting but it&apos;s still unclear if that will take place today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Update: The session is now adjourned as the political parties regroup to try and seek a resolution on this.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 51.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 50.4 vs 50.1 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 50.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The reading reaffirms stagnation in the euro area economy to start Q2, with the services sector experiencing a stall. Demand conditions continue to suffer and that&apos;s not a good look amid a more challenging economic backdrop in the months ahead. The good news at least is that price pressures have eased a touch further on the month. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Eurozone economic growth slowed at the start of the second quarter, following a pick-up in the first three months of the
year. The services sector, which is a major player, practically stagnated in April. Even though manufacturing output saw a
surprising uptick, it wasn&apos;t enough to prevent the overall slowdown in growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;In the services sector, cost pressures are still relatively high, though they have eased a bit over the past couple of months.
Inflation is down for sales prices and continued to trend lower. Many members of the European Central Bank (ECB) have
been hinting at another interest rate cut in June, and these latest figures seem to support their stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Euro area employment has seen a slight stabilization. The drop in headcounts among manufacturers has been more-thancounterbalanced by an increase in jobs within the service sector. Overall, there&apos;s still a noticeable hesitation to hire new staff,
which isn&apos;t too surprising given the current uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Spain is leading the pack in terms of growth, followed by Italy, then Germany with marginal growth, and France trailing
behind. This is reflected in the Composite PMI data for the first four months of 2025 and aligns with Eurostat&apos;s GDP data for
the first quarter. We expect Germany to soon outpace Italy thanks to a generous fiscal package, while France is likely to
remain at the bottom for now due to its uncertain political climate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany Composite PMI Output Index at 4-month low.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimism towards year-ahead outlook wanes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The German service sector has hit the brakes. Business activity dipped a bit in April, ending a four-month streak of growth.
The composite PMI didn&apos;t slip into recession territory, thanks to manufacturing companies ramping up production, just like
they did in March after a slump that lasted nearly two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Service providers probably felt the squeeze on profit margins in April. Costs went up more than last month, but they had to
dial back on price hikes. With this in mind, confidence about future business took a hit, with the index dropping further below
its long-term average.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At first glance, the future doesn&apos;t look too bright. New business has shrunk for the eighth month in a row, order book
backlogs have been sliding downhill for most of the past two years, and there&apos;s no sign of a solid recovery in exports. But,
companies are still hiring, and job growth has even picked up for the second month straight. Clearly, businesses aren&apos;t ready
to throw in the towel just yet. And for good reason, as the new government, expected to start this week, could well give the
economy a boost with its fiscal stimulus program in infrastructure and defence, plus more social spending. All of this should
also spread to the services sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 47.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 47.8 vs 47.3 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 48.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The slight revision higher doesn&apos;t take away from the fact that French business activity has now contracted for eight straight months. Demand conditions remain subdued and that&apos;s troubling amid a more challenging outlook in the months ahead. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;April marked another month of declining activity in the French private sector. The HCOB Composite PMI signals a
continued downturn in economic activity in France, driven by weakness in the services sector. However, the manufacturing
sector has managed to increase production for the first time in nearly three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;The French services sector remains on a downward trajectory. Business activity declined again in April, attributed to lower
customer demand and generally poorer market conditions. The rapid decline in new orders is particularly concerning this
month. Surveyed companies report that weak market conditions make it very difficult to attract new business, and existing
customers are also hesitant to engage in new transactions. High trade policy uncertainty seems to be causing
postponements to investment and consumption decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Current developments – weak demand amid high uncertainty – do not bode well for the profit margins of French service
providers. Additionally, our survey results indicate that operating costs, appear to be rising faster than end prices, which
have virtually stagnated due to competitive pressures.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Future business expectations remain in the growth zone, but significantly below the historical average. Employees find
themselves in a concerning situation, as they are increasingly at risk of job loss as workloads decrease due to the order
slump and simultaneous reduction of backlogs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

tourism and hospitality have supported growth in the service sector during the first months of the year, which suggests a
certain degree of sustainability. In the manufacturing sector, the question remains as to whether this sector could soon be hit
harder by US tariffs and EU countermeasures. For the year as a whole, we expect economic growth of around half a
percent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The service sector is showing relatively robust growth, which has accelerated slightly compared with the previous month.
Accordingly, service providers have once again hired more people, especially as they were also able to expand new
business more strongly than in March. It’s encouraging that most people were hired on a permanent basis, as panellists
said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tariff uncertainty could also indirectly weigh on the service sector, with the challenging economic and geopolitical
climate mentioned by panellists as having weighed on expectations regarding future activity, with the index already well
below its long-term average. However, especially in these times, the service sector is likely to maintain its role as a stabiliser
of the Italian economy, which it has held for around two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is some slight relief on the cost side for service companies. Operating costs have not risen quite as sharply as in
previous months. However, companies were also unable to increase sales prices at the same pace as before and had to
settle for significantly lower increases, meaning that profit margins were unlikely to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proposed 0 for 0 tariffs on industrial goods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accelerating trade talks with India among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another €170B US-exports may be impacted by tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ready to use all available tools in trade defence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s nothing new here as we&apos;ve been aware of the 0 for 0 offer for weeks. The problem is that we still haven&apos;t got any breakthrough. Last week, French Finance Minister Lombard said that he discussed the idea of reciprocal 
zero tariffs with Scott Bessent, and Bessent told him that it was not 
unrealistic. So, this will keep the hopes alive.&lt;/p&gt;
