                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ is reporting that Beijing weighs Fentanyl offer to US to start the trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing and distribution of a drug whose purpose to kill is a good idea. I know the US and China have differences, but to knowingly flood through smuggling a drug that kills indiscriminately is just as evil as you can get.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;162&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD buyers had their opportunity earlier this week, briefly driving the price to the highest level since March 2022 (above 1.3433) — but they couldn’t sustain the breakout. The pair reversed lower after reaching 1.34413, just above the 2024 high of 1.3433, marking a failed upside attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;735&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since then, the pair has moved lower and broke below both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages (blue and green lines on the chart above) on Wednesday. The 100-hour MA capped Wednesday’s corrective rebound keeping the sellers in control in the short term. On Thursday and again today, the lower 200-hour MA (green line) has contained upside attempts, reinforcing resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, buyers showed resilience today as the price found support at yesterday’s low, forming a temporary floor. This repeat bounce raises the importance of this area as a key short-term support level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It would take a move below that level to open the door toward the low from last week and 1.3232. Below that a swing level at 1.3201 – 1.3206 would be targeted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the low price from yesterday and today cannot be broken, dip buyers would still need to get the price back above the 200 and 100-hour moving averages to get more upside confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are more in control with the corrective highs this week stalling below the hourly moving average levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Technical Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1182&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1185&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1185&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;200-hour MA (~1.33298)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1211&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1213&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;100-hour MA (~1.3352)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1237&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1239&quot; data-end=&quot;1256&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;2024 high: 1.3433&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1258&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1260&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1277&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Double bottom near 1.3259&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3232 (last week’s low)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.32017 to 1.3206.

                            &lt;p&gt;Axios is reporting that Stephen Miller is gaining momentum as a top contender to become President Trump’s next national security adviser (NSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;311&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;313&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Miller is currently the Homeland Security adviser and a key architect of Trump&apos;s immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;425&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;427&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The position opened after Mike Waltz was removed as NSA and nominated to be the next U.N. ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;537&quot; data-end=&quot;658&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;539&quot; data-end=&quot;658&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily handling NSA duties, but is said to be too busy to do both long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;659&quot; data-end=&quot;787&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;661&quot; data-end=&quot;787&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Miller has impressed internally, running the Homeland Security Council “like clockwork” with far fewer staff than the NSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;169&quot; data-end=&quot;487&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF is trading in a choppy fashion following the U.S. jobs report, moving above and below its converged 100- and 200-hour moving averages, both currently near 0.8254. The pair has traded between a session high of 0.8275 and a low of 0.8226, effectively bracketing those key technical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;774&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The convergence of the moving averages reflects the sideways price action seen over the past eight trading days. As shown in the red box on the chart, the pair has been confined to a narrow 138-pip range, with lows repeatedly forming near 0.8195 and highs capped at 0.8333.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;776&quot; data-end=&quot;1076&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This consolidation phase comes after a steep drop from the April high of 0.8855 to the April low of 0.8039. The current sideways pattern suggests that the market is undecided — weighing whether to resume the broader downtrend or attempt a more meaningful retracement of the April decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, a break outside the 0.8195–0.8333 range will be needed to clarify the next directional move.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a relatively quick turnaround by Canadian standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The solid non-farm payrolls print today and rebound in the stock market has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/june-fed-cut-odds-sink-after-the-jobs-report-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;pricing &lt;/a&gt;for a June cut down to 40% from as high as 75% last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is now piling on and pushing their cut fall to the July 30 meeting from June 18. With today&apos;s jobs report, the Fed won&apos;t get another one before the June meeting and that will make it tough to justify a cut, even if the June print is soft (it would just be one number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Goldman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 177k in April, above expectations. Payroll growth was revised down by 43k in March and 15k in February. The three-month average of payroll growth now stands at 155k. The unemployment rate was unchanged on a rounded basis at 4.2%. Our estimate of the underlying pace of job growth based on the payroll and household surveys now stands at 149k. We are pushing back the first fed funds rate cut in our forecast to the July FOMC meeting (vs. June previously), reflecting today&apos;s better-than-expected payrolls report and a better-than-feared April ISM reading yesterday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The comments from Trump after Carney&apos;s win sparked some optimism that US-Canada tensions would ebb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we&apos;re going to have a great relationship,&quot; he says. &quot;He was 
running for office. They both hated Trump -- and it was the one that 
hated Trump the least, I think, that won.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what would be the ultimate deal? If Trump pledges quick approvals on the Keystone XL pipeline. It would be a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The stock market is showing a vibrant landscape today, with the technology sector leading a healthy upward trend. However, not all is bullish, as major tech player Apple faces significant declines amidst otherwise positive growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📈 Technology Sector: A Beacon of Growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology sector stands out with remarkable gains. Microsoft (MSFT) is up 2.70%, accompanied by Oracle (ORCL) gaining 4.12% and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surging 5.51%. These movements are driven by positive earnings reports and upbeat forecasts in tech infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📉 Consumer Electronics: Apple&apos;s Decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) is experiencing a substantial drop of 2.98%, due to issues surrounding supply chain constraints and market saturation concerns. This downturn places pressure on the consumer electronics segment, making it a critical focal point for potential correction in upcoming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚀 Communication Services: Sustaining Momentum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the communication services sector, both Google (GOOG) and Meta Platforms (META) show robust growth, with gains of 1.90% and 3.93%, respectively. These stocks are buoyed by increased digital ad spending and expanding user bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏦 Financial Sector: Steady Climb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial sector displays steady optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) are both up by 2.20%, while Visa (V) sees a rise of 1.72%. Investors appear confident in financials as interest rates remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏥 Healthcare Surges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is another top performer today. Eli Lilly (LLY) climbs 2.94% after positive results from its latest clinical trials. This surge highlights the sector’s resilience and potential for continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💡 Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, today’s market reflects a positive sentiment with notable sector-specific dynamics. The robust performance in technology and healthcare counters the weakness in consumer electronics, specifically Apple. Today&apos;s resilience against external economic concerns suggests a cautiously optimistic view from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📊 Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may want to capitalize on the momentum in tech and healthcare sectors, potentially rebalancing portfolios to reduce exposure to underperforming segments like consumer electronics. Monitoring supply chain developments and upcoming earnings releases will be key for informed decision-making. As always, staying tuned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; will keep you updated on these dynamic market shifts. 📊&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;351&quot; data-end=&quot;625&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD moved higher in early U.S. trading on Friday, breaking decisively above both its 100-hour moving average at 1.1356 and 200-hour moving average at 1.1363. This move marks a clear bullish shift in short-term momentum after several days of consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;627&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier in the week, the pair found consistent support near the 1.1265–1.1270 area, with today’s low holding just above that zone at 1.12735. The rebound from that base helped fuel the latest upside extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;846&quot; data-end=&quot;1076&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With price now trading at new highs for the day, attention shifts to the descending trendline near 1.1403, followed by the weekly high at 1.1424. A break above those levels would open the door for further bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, initial support now comes in at the broken 100- and 200-hour moving averages (1.1352–1.1363). Below that, traders will be eyeing the 1.1328–1.1307 swing area, which previously acted as a strong floor earlier this week and again on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1010&quot; data-end=&quot;1038&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Technical Levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1039&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1039&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1041&quot; data-end=&quot;1056&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1087&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1061&quot; data-end=&quot;1087&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1403 (topside trendline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1090&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1092&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1424 (high for the week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1121&quot; data-end=&quot;1133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1136&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1138&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1351–1.1363 (100/200-hour MAs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1173&quot; data-end=&quot;1205&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1175&quot; data-end=&quot;1205&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1328 and 1.1307 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1208&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1210&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.1265–1.1270 (major base zone)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a big week for the oil market with the main OPEC+ meeting set for Monday. There have been some conflicting reports about how eager OPEC is to bring back curtailed barrels and how far Saudi Arabia is willing to go to punish cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI is struggling today down 95-cents to $58.31. I&apos;m not sure this report tells us anything.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Despite a jobs report that means (according to WSJ Timiraos, that the &quot;Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&quot; and &quot;makes a June rate cut less likely&quot;, the USD is moving lower with the USDCAD extending to new lows for the year and the lowest level for the year and going back to October 2024.  Reports that Canada PM Carney is meeting Trump may be hopeful of a deal for Canada sooner rather than later (or maybe not?) and may be supportive for the CAD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;220&quot; data-end=&quot;515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the USDCAD tried to rebound earlier today but ran into stiff resistance near the 100-hour (1.3825) and 200-hour (1.3842) moving averages, which capped the upside. The high price reached 1.3837—just below the 200-hour MA—before sellers took control and pushed the pair back lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, support has reemerged near the April low and red-box consolidation floor at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the pair broke briefly below this level to a new cycle low of 1.3769, but momentum faded and buyers stepped in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both those targets have now been breached today with the pair reaching another  new low for the day and going back to October 2024 at 1.37638. Not all that convincing, but If the corrective rally can be limited, a new push could be made with more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, for those not jumping on the sell the USD, the failed break gives the dip buyers a new low to lean against. If the price moves below, get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, however, the sellers are more in control. The price highs today stalled at the MAs - Bearish. A new low was made - Bearish. The price is trading new lows going back to October - Bearish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So if buying, understand that you are swimming against that tide. Understand the risk. &lt;/p&gt;

 Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to 
you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess he didn&apos;t know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected this would be India and that can still come today but the US dollar weakness today may be partly on trade disappointment and the harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments &lt;/a&gt;that came from Japan today.&lt;/p&gt;

Bezos, whose net worth is valued at over $200 billion, will sell up to 25 million shares in the company, valued at around $5 billion, Amazon disclosed in a regulatory filing Friday. The value of the shares could change, of course, depending on Amazon’s stock price. If it declines, they would be worth less, if it rises, they would be worth more.

                            &lt;p&gt;The market has taken down the implied probability of a June rate cut from upwards of 75% last week down to 42% at present. The latest leg in the shift came after a solid but unspectacular non-farm payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Timiraos from the WSJ highlights the Fed&apos;s view:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The April jobs report makes a June rate cut less likely (even though that is a world away) because there will only be one more employment report before then.

For now, it means the Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year ahead, the market is now pricing in 111 bps in easing, about 20 basis points below what it was pricing last week. The combination of this data, GDP, ISM manufacturing, PCE data and corporate comments about consumer spending (especially Visa) has the market feeling good about the state of the economy -- or at least the state of the economy heading into the tariff war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all makes me wonder: Where would the market be right now without the tariffs? Inflation falling, the Fed cutting even as economy accelerated and Congress focused on the tax package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) STEADY HIRING IN APRIL WILL REINFORCE FED&apos;S &quot;PATIENT&quot; STANCE -- NICK TIMIRAOS

     Federal Reserve officials have broadly indicated that interest-rate cuts will likely require clear signs of rising unemployment.
     Because April&apos;s employment report offers very few indications of a broad-based decline in hiring, Fed officials can easily maintain their wait-and-see posture at their policy meeting next week-including by saying little that would offer any sign the central bank is prepared to lower interest rates at its subsequent meeting in mid-June.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD moved higher but is retracing some of the moves after the US jobs report which came in with the month revisions last month, about expectations.  This month rose 177K vs 130K (+47K), but the prior month was revised to 185K from 228K (-43K). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD: The EURUSD moved to a low of 1.1303 which briefly traded below lows from last week at 1.13072. However, the price is trading back higher and trades at 1.1330 currently. The high today stallled at the 100 hour moving average near 1.13516 currently .  Support 1.1307. Resistance 1.13516 now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY: The USDJPY moved up to 144.95, but is back down trading at 144.55 currently. There is a swing area between 144.45 and 144.55 that if broken would have traders looking toward the broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the March 27 high. That level comes in at 144.208.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD: The GBPUSD initially moved lower, but found buyers near the low from yesterday and the low for the week at 1.32594. The low price reached 1.3260. The next target on the top side comes in at 1.32922 followed by the high for the day near 1.3320 and the 200 hour moving average of 1.3330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDCAD: The USDCAD moved higher but found a willing seller&apos;s between the 200 hour moving average of 1.3842 and the 100 hour moving average of 1.32295. The high price reached and 1.32378 before rotating back to the downside. If the price is going higher it needs to get and stay above those moving averages. On the downside, the low of the red box consolidation area comes in at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the price moved below that level to a low of 1.3769 but could not sustain momentum and reestablished support against the prior low at 1.3781 before moving higher during yesterday&apos;s trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at US stocks in premarket trading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average up 438 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index up 64.61 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ up 214 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market yields are higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.770%, +6.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5  year yield 3.880%, +6.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.283%, +5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.779%, +4.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Happy Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures are upbeat on the comments from China about trade but I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments from Japan &lt;/a&gt;to be the story today, as the US appears &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-reluctant-to-exempt-japan-from-10-reciprocal-tariff-kyodo-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;to be set&lt;/a&gt; on leaving the majority of tariffs on permanently, including the 10% floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the market can turn away from tariffs for a few minutes and focus on the domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AnnaEconomist/status/1918040523249537501&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chart from Anna Wong&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the seasonal trend in leisure and hospitality hiring. Those are two industries that are likely to struggle in the months ahead, along with transport and construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that if today&apos;s report is strong, it will delay the inevitable pain from this later while if it&apos;s weak, then there was softness even ahead of this. I&apos;m not sure I agree but that&apos;s the sentiment that&apos;s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt; B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD is lower vs the major currency pairs - the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD - ahead of the US jobs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectation is for the jobs shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-farm payroll 130K vs 228K last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unemployment rate 4.2% vs 4.2% last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average hourly earnings 0.3% vs 0.3% last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average workweek 34.2 hours vs 34.2 hours last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers released so far this month:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADP report +62K versus +147K prior (lowest in almost 2 years)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISM services employment not yet released&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISM manufacturing employment 46.5 vs 44.7 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-april-challenger-layoffs-10544k-vs-27524k-prior-20250501/&quot;&gt;Challenger &lt;/a&gt;job cuts 105.44k vs 275.2k prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philly employment +0.2 vs +19.7 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empire employment -2.6 vs -4.1 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial jobless claims survey week 216K vs 225K prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonals from BMO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In April, the headline beat 57% of the time and missed 43% of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On unemployment, the rate has been lower than expected 42% of the time, higher 39% of the time and in line 19% of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADP looms large ahead of the report and the recent JOLTS number was soft but the initial jobless claims numbers lately haven&apos;t shown any sign of layoffs, including today&apos;s number which was skewed by New York teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN the video above, I take a look at the technical drivers for each of the major currency pairs ahead of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware. Be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets ahead of the report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is down $0.70 or -1.16% at $58.55&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading up $22 or 0.70% at $3261.40&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading at $320 at $96,855&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;in the premarket for US stocks, the US futures are implying a marginally higher opening. The S&amp;amp;P index is up for eight consecutive days:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average +168 points after rising 83.6 points or 0.21% yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index is up 19.36 points after rising 35.08 points or 0.63% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index of 54 points after rising 264.40 points or 1.52% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US that market, yields are mixed with the shorter and marginally higher in the longer an marginally lower: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.716%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5- year yield 3.819%, +0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.225%, -0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.17 1%, -1.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Microsoft&apos;s Earnings Breakout: The $400 Threshold and Investor Insights</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Round Numbers Matter: Microsoft&apos;s $400 Threshold and What Comes Next&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in tech stocks often focus intensely on financial statements, earnings calls, and analyst forecasts. However, experienced market participants know there&apos;s another vital aspect of trading and investing—psychological price levels, specifically round numbers. Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings-driven surge past the critical $400 threshold provides a compelling case study. But what exactly does this round-number milestone mean for investors, and why should they pay close attention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Psychological Power of Round Numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round numbers, such as $100, $200, $400, or $500, often serve as psychological barriers or support levels. These figures hold emotional significance for traders and investors, influencing buying and selling decisions in ways financial fundamentals alone cannot explain. Microsoft&apos;s decisive move above the $400 mark, propelled by strong earnings fueled by aggressive AI investments, has clear psychological implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s Milestone: Decoding the Market Reaction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft shares surged nearly 8% following robust earnings results, investors quickly noticed the breakout beyond $400, reaching approximately $425. Such breakouts can signal the start of a sustained bullish trend, provided the stock maintains support above this new level. Alternatively, a swift reversal below $400 would signal potential vulnerability and caution investors to reassess their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical Context and Future Projections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, stocks crossing key round-number thresholds often experience heightened volatility shortly after the event, as market participants test the new level’s durability. Investors need to observe Microsoft&apos;s performance in the immediate days and weeks following its breakout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario A: Consolidation and Further Gains
If Microsoft maintains price stability above $400, particularly consolidating near current levels ($425 range), it will indicate sustained market confidence, potentially attracting additional buying pressure. Investors can then anticipate the next psychological target at $450 or even $500 as viable milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario B: Failure and Retest
Conversely, if Microsoft retraces sharply and fails to hold above $400, it could indicate market doubts regarding the sustainability of recent earnings-driven enthusiasm. Such a scenario might trigger a retest of lower support levels, possibly around $380 or $370, creating cautionary signals for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from Market Examples&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Google stock&apos;s journey when it initially breached the $200 per share at the end of 2024 per. This was a psychological barrierfor the stock. The stock experienced intense investor enthusiasm immediately following the breakout, yet volatility remained high. Subsequent trading patterns helped clarify the durability of investor confidence at that critical level, confirmed on 05 Feb 2025 after its earnings report, as the price had its first close under the $200 round number, opening the door for another massive 26% down. While I am not saying that the decline was not driven by other factors, but that this round number, as happens many times, is another psychological trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft investors should similarly watch volatility closely post-breakout. If its future is indeed bright, as shown in this week&apos;s earnings report, it must not even come close to playing with the $400 round number. Being far enough away at $425, that ship has sailed... if, indeed, the future is bright for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round numbers are important junctions that hint about the state of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Strategies: Navigating Psychological Thresholds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should apply disciplined strategies when stocks approach or breach significant round numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor Volume and Volatility: Increased trading volume accompanied by stable or rising prices after crossing a key level indicates robust investor support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assess Fundamental Strength: Validate price moves with ongoing fundamental analysis, ensuring that price action aligns with genuine financial strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk Management: Utilize clear stop-loss and profit-taking strategies around these psychological levels to manage risk effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Why Microsoft&apos;s $400 Milestone Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s breakout above $400 isn&apos;t merely symbolic—it is practically significant. Investors who understand the psychological dynamics surrounding round numbers gain additional tools for informed decision-making. Observing Microsoft&apos;s behavior at this critical juncture can yield valuable insights into the stock&apos;s short- to medium-term trajectory, informing smarter, more strategic investment choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Microsoft&apos;s $400 breakout is an instructive moment for investors, highlighting why paying attention to psychological price levels remains a critical aspect of sophisticated stock market investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert (and just an opinon...

                            &lt;p&gt;Big Tech Earnings: Separating Headlines from Reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When big tech giants like this week&apos;s Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta report earnings, headlines quickly flood the market. These headlines often shape immediate investor sentiment and trading behavior. However, insightful investors understand a crucial truth: Headlines can mislead, and the actual price action provides the ultimate reality check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Real Market Response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s recent earnings serve as a prime example. Despite seemingly solid financial results—5% revenue growth and 12% increase in service revenues—Apple&apos;s stock fell approximately 3% pre-market. Why the disconnect? Investor uncertainty about future quarters and tariff impacts overshadowed strong headline figures. This illustrates why investors must go beyond superficial earnings narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines vs. Price Action: The Case of Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Microsoft&apos;s earnings headlines matched the positive price action, as shares surged nearly 8% following strong revenue gains attributed directly to strategic AI investments. The sustained positive price movement validated investors&apos; optimistic interpretation of Microsoft&apos;s headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Investors Should Prioritize Price Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Sentiment: Price action captures market sentiment comprehensively, reflecting collective investor judgment, including hidden risks or optimistic insights not immediately apparent in headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Validation: Sustained positive or negative price movement after earnings announcements often accurately predicts long-term performance better than short-lived headline-driven volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should adopt a disciplined approach, watching stock performance closely for several days post-earnings rather than reacting impulsively to initial headlines. Stocks maintaining strong positive momentum (like Microsoft and Meta currently exhibit) signal genuine market confidence. Conversely, sustained weakness (as observed recently in Apple and Amazon) indicates deeper investor skepticism or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, wise investors will leverage headlines as initial signals, validating these signals through careful monitoring of subsequent price action. This strategy helps distinguish genuine investment opportunities from transient market noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Cyclical Dilemma: Is AWS at an AI Crossroads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon&apos;s latest earnings report, accompanied by a roughly 2.5% decline in pre-market trading, highlights investor concerns about cyclical pressures and profitability—particularly in its AWS cloud computing division. Amid escalating investments in artificial intelligence (AI), AWS faces critical questions that investors must consider: Will AWS overcome short-term cyclical headwinds, or is it at a crossroads that might redefine its future profitability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Profitability Pressures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS has historically been a primary profit driver for Amazon, often subsidizing investments into other segments, including e-commerce. However, recent earnings indicate rising operating costs and margin pressures, partly due to significant capital expenditure on AI infrastructure. Investors are rightfully concerned whether these costs will yield sustained returns or weigh down profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Amazon’s AI Strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike competitors such as Microsoft, which has rapidly monetized AI through Azure, Amazon has faced challenges demonstrating similar immediate returns from its AI investments. AWS’s expansive AI-related CapEx suggests potential long-term rewards, but investors must weigh these anticipated future benefits against immediate margin pressures and operational risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Insights: Metrics to Watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors focusing on Amazon should closely monitor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Operating Margins: Consistent improvements here could indicate successful AI integration and cost management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue Growth in AWS: Accelerated growth rates could reflect increased demand for AI-powered cloud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CapEx Efficiency: How efficiently Amazon converts its heavy investments into tangible, scalable revenue streams will significantly influence long-term valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Crossroads for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon investors face a strategic decision point. They must assess whether AWS’s current cyclical downturn represents an opportune moment to position for potential future upside or signals deeper structural challenges requiring caution. Investors should critically evaluate quarterly financial performance, particularly AWS-related metrics, as a litmus test of Amazon’s long-term AI strategy viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while AWS remains integral to Amazon’s long-term growth narrative, investors must carefully discern whether current cyclical pressures mask deeper profitability issues or offer a strategic entry point for future growth driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

It is being reported that the US is reluctant to drop the reciprocal 10% tariffs, alongside auto, steel, and aluminum tariffs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s hardly an optimistic sign on how Trump is setting his team to approach negotiations in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, Japan is hitting back at that and saying that they are firmly opposing the US&apos; proposal. Finance minister Kato even went as far as saying that they could even look at the country&apos;s Treasury holdings as &quot;a card&quot; in negotiations, but &quot;whether or not we use that card is a different decision&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The next discussion will only take place after the middle of May. So, that&apos;s the can being kicked down the road for yet another two weeks. So much for quick progress, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The stalemate serves as a warning for other countries as well, with the clock continuing to count down. Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were up 0.8% earlier in the day before paring a chunk of that to be up just 0.2% during the session. Overall, the animal spirits are still holding up but we&apos;ll see if that is enough to keep the win streak going in Wall Street to wrap up the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In FX, the dollar is once again offered amid the less than ideal trade headlines. EUR/USD pushed up above 1.1300 to 1.1340 while USD/JPY is down 0.6% to 144.50 currently, after hanging around 145.20 in the handover from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The euro is also getting some slight help from a hotter-than-expected Eurozone core inflation estimate for April. The jump was largely due to services inflation and that will give the ECB something to think about before the likely next rate cut in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, USD/CHF is also marked down by 0.6% to 0.8238 while AUD/USD is seen up 0.8% to 0.6434 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is up again in a push to $3,260 levels while bond yields are slightly down with 10-year Treasury yields in particular holding just under its 200-day moving average of 4.22% for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s on to the US jobs report next before eyeing more trade/Trump headlines before the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Connection: What Big Tech Earnings Tell Us About AI Demand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent earnings reports from tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon have not only captured investor attention but also provided crucial insights into the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this AI wave is NVIDIA, the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), essential hardware powering AI infrastructure. How might NVIDIA be impacted by the latest signals from big tech earnings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong AI Momentum From Microsoft and Meta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Meta have demonstrated substantial financial returns from their aggressive AI strategies. Microsoft&apos;s integration of OpenAI’s GPT technology into Azure and Meta’s robust AI-driven user engagement metrics suggest rapid growth in enterprise demand for AI capabilities. These developments directly increase the need for NVIDIA’s powerful GPUs, positioning NVIDIA as a significant beneficiary of the current AI expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple and Amazon: More Measured Approaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Apple and Amazon have displayed a more cautious or cyclical approach to AI. Apple’s incremental, quality-focused AI development could mean slower immediate demand for NVIDIA’s hardware, while Amazon’s mixed earnings from AWS indicate potential short-term constraints in GPU-related CapEx spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for NVIDIA Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors assessing NVIDIA’s outlook should closely track:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sustained strength of Microsoft’s and Meta’s AI-related earnings, indicating continued robust demand for NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of accelerated AI infrastructure investments from Apple and Amazon, potentially further boosting GPU demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic factors and tariff-related risks that could influence tech spending patterns broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight Through Competitor Comparisons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divergent strategies of these big tech firms offer valuable comparisons for NVIDIA investors. Microsoft&apos;s and Meta’s rapid and profitable AI adoption underscores the immediate positive potential for NVIDIA’s earnings. Meanwhile, the slower approaches of Amazon and Apple illustrate how varying AI strategies can impact hardware demand differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, recent big tech earnings provide clear signals of strong ongoing demand for AI infrastructure, particularly benefiting NVIDIA’s position as a critical hardware provider. Investors should closely monitor tech companies&apos; AI investment trajectories and NVIDIA&apos;s stock performance in the coming quarters for validation of these trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;Meta’s Quiet AI Revolution: More Profitable Than You Think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta Platforms&apos; recent earnings report underscores a crucial narrative investors shouldn&apos;t overlook—the company&apos;s highly effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Following the earnings release, Meta shares surged around 4.25% yesterday and continued to show resilience today, up an additional 0.9% pre-market. So, what&apos;s driving investor optimism, and how is Meta quietly becoming a top AI player?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI as a Direct Profit Driver for META Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many companies merely experimenting with AI, Meta is already achieving tangible returns. The company has successfully used AI to significantly enhance user engagement on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. With daily active users reaching 3.4 billion—over 60% of the global daily online population—Meta’s ability to sustain and grow user engagement through AI-driven personalization and content targeting is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margin Expansion at META&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta&apos;s investment in AI isn&apos;t just about boosting user numbers. AI implementation has also directly contributed to improved profitability. Meta recently reported operating margins at 41%, substantially surpassing market expectations. This profitability boost can partly be attributed to efficiency gains from AI-enhanced internal operations, including streamlined coding and content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta AI&apos;s Strategic Roadmap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta&apos;s continued strategic focus on AI, highlighting five key areas: engagement, content creation, business messaging, Meta AI chatbots, and hardware through Reality Labs. Investors should recognize this as a roadmap for sustained revenue growth and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta vs. Competitors: An Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Meta&apos;s aggressive AI integration strategy with the slower approaches of competitors like Apple provides investors a valuable benchmark. While Apple&apos;s cautious pace in AI raises market uncertainties, Meta’s swift execution demonstrates how proactive AI investments can immediately and substantially benefit earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should carefully watch Meta’s stock performance in the coming quarters, particularly noting whether this strong positive sentiment continues. Continued growth in user engagement metrics and sustained margin improvements will likely reinforce Meta&apos;s position as a leader in leveraging AI for profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, Meta’s quiet AI revolution is becoming loudly profitable, offering a compelling example for investors of how AI can transform corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.
