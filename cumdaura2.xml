                            &lt;p&gt;Wages data from Japan for March 2025 showed overtime salaries fell at the
fastest pace in almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;total earnings +2.1% y/y (expected +2.3%, prior +3.1%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;overtime pay -1.1% y/y (prior +2.4%) (overtime pay is often seen as an indicator of business actiivty, ie weakening in this case)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;inflation adjusted, &apos;real&apos; wages -2.1% y/y (down for the third month in a row) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results will be an encouragement to the Bank of Japan to hike rates in the near term. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Lost amid the noise on tariffs was the news from TSLA that its officially canning the Cybertruck range extender battery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla confirmed to Cybertruck owners that it’s “no longer planning to sell” the $16,000 battery pack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla will issue refunds for any deposit put down by customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The range extender was problematic from the get-go:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;would have taken up around half of the Cybertruck’s rear bed space&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;initially estimates extended the range to a total of 470 miles, but was soon trimmed to 445 miles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;original release date was said to be early 2025, later shunted to mid-2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C-truck design has been lambasted &lt;/p&gt;

That put the BOE Chair Bailey in the hot seat as he maneuvered through Q&amp;amp;A questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rate cut, the BOE’s guidance remained unchanged, emphasizing a “gradual and careful” approach to easing—repeating the tone from March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the US and the UK announced the framework for a trade deal. According to US commerce Sec. Lutnick, the deal adds US$5 billion of opportunity for US exporters, and keeps a 10% tariff on all goods in place. He added that UK would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes. The US said that they would allow Rolls-Royce engines and plan parts to come over tariff free and exempted Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles from tariffs as well (thank goodness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trump, he and PM Starmer reached an agreement that will increase access for U.S. beef and ethanol, while also committing to reduce non-tariff barriers. As part of the deal, the UK will fast-track U.S. goods through customs, allowing for quicker movement in both directions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final details of the agreement are expected to be finalized in the coming weeks - a sentiement expressed by UK officials as well. Additionally, the U.S. will gain new market access for chemicals and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Josh Brown on CNBC said sarcastically, &quot;The US reached an agreement with its strongest ally for the last 200 plus years. Amazing news.&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Trump spoke of confidence for the forthcoming meetings with China over the weekend, and the NY Post, reported that the US may cut tariffs on China goods to 50% by as early as next week. Trump said the best a country can do is 10% tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks were supported with gains now over the last 2 trading days after declines on the first 2 days of the week. For the day and the week (with one day to go):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow rose 0.62%, and holding to a 0.12 gain for the week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P rose 0.58%, but is still down -0.40% for the week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq rose 1.07% but is down -0.28% for the week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the week will decide up or down for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD move up vs the major currencies.  A snapshot of the greenbacks gains vs the currencies showed the strongest gain vs the JPY (+1.45%) and the smallest gain vs the AUD (+0.34). The EUR fell -0.54% vs the USD and the GBP in volatile up and down trading on all the headline news, fell -0.37%.  The CHF rose 1.01% vs the USD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields moved higher helping to support the USD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.880%, +8.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield 3.986%, +11.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.380%, +10.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.846%, +7.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US auctioned off $25B of 30 year bonds but was met with tepid demand (0.7 basis point tail and lower than average Bid to cover).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil rose $2.17 or 3.74% to $60.24&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold fell $60 or -1.79% to $3304.98&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin rose $5558 or 5.73% to $102,608&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The New York Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/business/us-weighs-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-as-soon-as-next-week-sources/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that the US is weighing a plan to slash China tariffs to as low as 50% next week from 145%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;US officials are discussing a proposal to lower President Trump’s punishing levy on China goods to between 50% and 54% as they begin what promise to be lengthy talks to hammer out a trade agreement, sources close to the negotiations said&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs on neighbouring south Asian countries would be cut to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s crazy how much of this already appears to have leaked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In response, a “whisper” campaign spread quickly and “the number that emerged to get the ships flowing out of China was 54%,” said Jay Foreman, CEO of Basic Fun, which makes its retro toys in China including Tonka Trucks, Care Bears and My Little Pony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The signals we are getting is that the dam will break by the end of this week or next, that there will be an adjustment,” Foreman told The Post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Accordingly, many retailers already have begun asking vendors to quote prices based on a range of tariff rates — anywhere between 10% and 54% — “so they are ready to price when the goods land” in the US, Foreman added.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t have insider information, this market is tough to trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The retailers behavior changed after the White House meeting as if they got some confidence,” said retail guru Gerald Storch, a former CEO of Toys R Us and Canadian based department store company HBC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 took quite a jump that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today Trump said to &apos;buy stocks&apos; and plenty of people did because it was reminiscent of his message a few hours before he removed the reciprocal tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;145&quot; data-end=&quot;712&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, as widely expected, but the surprise came in the vote split. The decision passed with a 7-2-0 vote, falling short of the anticipated unanimous 9-0-0. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden pushed for a deeper 50 basis point cut, while Catherine Mann and Huw Pill unexpectedly voted to keep rates unchanged at 4.50%. That unexpected hawkish dissent triggered a kneejerk reaction in sterling, with GBPUSD spiking from around 1.3241 to 1.3344 before fading and rotating back toward session lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;714&quot; data-end=&quot;1047&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the rate cut, the BOE’s guidance remained unchanged, emphasizing a “gradual and careful” approach to easing—repeating the tone from March. As in previous meetings, markets quickly shifted focus from the headline rate move to the vote distribution, which revealed a more divided Monetary Policy Committee than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1049&quot; data-end=&quot;1620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the intraday reversal has turned the momentum back in favor of sellers. The pair has now retraced toward the day’s low at 1.3241, with a break below that level and the April 23 low at 1.3233 opening the door toward a swing area between 1.32017 and 1.32067. A move below that zone would target the 38.2% retracement of the April rally at 1.31603. With the price back under both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, sellers have short-term control—but they’ll need a break of those downside targets to confirm and extend the bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $59.91, up $1.84 or 3.17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price today reached $57.77. The high reached $60.02.  Technically, the price is closing above the 100/200 hour MAs at $58.30 and $59.15.  Getting and staying above those MAs gives the buyers some hope with the 38.2% of the move down from the April high at $61.63 as the next target. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar stormed ahead today, particularly USD/JPY which is now up 210 pips to 145.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on what&apos;s driving the move:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) A delayed reaction to the Fed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell was hawkish yesterday and the market has priced out about 40 basis points in Fed rate cuts in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The UK trade deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some element of smoke-and-mirrors with the UK trade deal but it&apos;s not devoid of substance. The US has been touting deals and got one here and the market may be anticipating more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The art of the deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&apos;s a preposterous idea to think the US can get away with a 10% tariff floor while asking other countries to bring down trade barriers but maybe I&apos;m wrong. The UK today lowered barriers for imports from the US and accepted -- at least for now -- a 10% tariff. And that&apos;s with the UK having a trade surplus with the USA. Maybe Trump really is a deal-making magician and he will roll more-meaningful US trade partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Trump sounded better on China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is the big one. He said that talks with China would be &apos;substantive&apos; and that tariffs would come down (though in part because &quot;they can&apos;t go any higher&quot;). It&apos;s not much but it&apos;s a change in tone and an indication that he expects progress this weekend. It&apos;s tough to read the tea leaves on this one but the market is sensing progress.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church has elected American Robert Prevost, 69, as its new leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the first American and the first native-English speaker to be named Pope but also speaks Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese and can read Latin and German. He has taken the name Leo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevost headed the Vatican Dicastery for Bishops, which is the office tasked with bishop appointments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are often worried about teaching doctrine, but we risk forgetting 
that our first duty is to communicate the beauty and joy of knowing 
Jesus,&quot; Prevost, in one of his few interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/papal-front-runner-interest-polyglot-us-cardinal-prevost-rises-italian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Vatican News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication said Prevost brings to the table pastoral experience in the peripheries with 
expertise in navigating the complexities of the church&apos;s central 
governance.&lt;/p&gt;
