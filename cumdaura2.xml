                            &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In June, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecmarkets.com/ec/fwkicv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;EC Markets&lt;/a&gt; will undertake initiatives that mark new, decisive steps in its worldwide expansion and consolidation within the financial sector. The company will play a leading role at the now established iFX Expo International 2025, which will be held from 17 to 19 June at the City of Dreams Mediterranean Resort in Limassol. This year’s iFX Expo is expected to be far more than a conventional exhibition: the gathering of thousands of financial-services professionals—representing more than 120 countries—aims to confirm its reputation as the pre-eminent forum for foreign-exchange markets, fintech and payment services both in Europe and globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;For EC Markets, Cyprus constitutes a significant strategic hub for regional and international development, and the iFX Expo provides a timely opportunity not only to showcase corporate excellence but also to demonstrate its guiding philosophy of transparency, technological superiority and meaningful human dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Official Sponsor of the Welcome Party at Columbia Beach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The exhibition formally opens on the evening of 17 June, and EC Markets, as exclusive sponsor of the Welcome Party, will host all participants at Columbia Beach, one of Limassol’s most iconic seafront venues. Against the backdrop of the Mediterranean and in an atmosphere that epitomises the city’s cosmopolitan character, guests will enjoy the occasion while initiating dialogue in a relaxed manner before the two demanding days that follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;For EC Markets, the Welcome Party offers an excellent opportunity to highlight a central element of its ethos: the role of the host who respects everyone active in the sector, viewing them not as competitors but as fellow travellers in the worlds of economics, innovation and entrepreneurial development. Participants in iFX Expo International 2025 will be welcomed by the CEO and Chairman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherwan-zeybo-1a3541b4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Mr &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-smith-6b130b8/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Matthew Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the Group Marketing Director, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-xydas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Mr Nick Xydas&lt;/a&gt;, the Global Head of Business Development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherwan-zeybo-1a3541b4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Mr Sherwan Zeybo&lt;/a&gt;, and the entire company team, in a space designed for productive and substantive discussions. Finally, the Welcome Party promises impressive surprises and a spectacular display that attendees will long remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;EC Markets at Booth 72 of iFX Expo Limassol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The following day, EC Markets will be at Booth 72, where our dynamic team will be available for face-to-face meetings. Visitors will have the opportunity to converse with specialist professionals and to learn about the company’s vision, as outlined by Mr Matthew Smith in early April at iFX LATAM 2025. Concurrently, EC Markets will sponsor the exhibition’s Beer Bar, providing a welcoming space in which attendees may relax and engage in informal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Summer Updates: A Season of Developmental Change for EC Markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The upward trajectory of EC Markets continues with further tangible developments. The company will officially launch its completely redesigned corporate website, which offers an optimised registration experience, multilingual educational content, analyses and updates, as well as advanced, innovative high-level tools. The new site reflects the company’s transition towards a digitally focused, data-centric operating models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Inauguration of New Offices in Limassol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In parallel with the website launch, EC Markets will inaugurate new offices in a modern, architecturally refined building overlooking Limassol’s Old Port. The premises will accommodate a creative, productive and diverse team, together with a content-production studio for educational and analytical material and will above all provide a secure space for dialogue in which diversity is embraced as a vital asset. This project underscores the company’s long-term commitment to investment in infrastructure and human capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;EC Markets Places Transparency, Technology and Education at the Centre of Its Strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;By integrating hospitality, technological advancement and an educational approach, EC Markets seeks to redefine the contemporary profile of a global broker. Its participation in iFX Expo International 2025, together with the forthcoming website launch and the new offices, exemplifies a mature strategy that, step by step, places transparency, education and regional specialisation at its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Those interested in following developments may visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecmarkets.com/ec/fwkicv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;ecmarkets.com&lt;/a&gt; or follow EC Markets on its official social-media channels for continuous updates on all initiatives and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traders trim bets on BoE easing favouring just one rate cut in 2025</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The market pricing now sees 34 bps of easing in 2025 compared to 41 bps before the UK CPI release. The next cut is fully priced in for November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is still a bit high in my opinion and I would expect some more hawkish repricing in the next weeks and months for the BoE and for other major central banks.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior +2.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core CPI +3.8% vs +3.6% y/y expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior +3.4%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services CPI +5.4% vs +4.8% y/y expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior +4.7%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big upside surprise for UK inflation. The market will certainly reprice the rate cut expectations to something like 25-28 bps of easing by year-end (one rate cut) and even then I&apos;m skeptical the BoE will be able to cut again in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the risk I&apos;ve been talking about in the last few weeks. It&apos;s not growth, it&apos;s inflation now. And that will likely be the same for the ECB and the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a bloodbath in the Japanese super-long bond market recently as yields continue to surge to record highs. Yesterday, the BoJ released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/boj-some-members-said-jgb-market-functionality-improving-as-a-trend-due-to-bojs-taper-20250520/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;briefing material &lt;/a&gt;used at its meeting with bond market participants and although there were different opinions, lower liquidity and demand for super-long bonds have been cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some market participants urged the BoJ to increase buying of super-long bonds, or terminate tapering for that maturity given the current blowout. Most of them agree that slowing the pace of tapering could alleviate the stress at a time where debts are coming into greater focus. The recent comment from Japanese PM saying that their fiscal state is &quot;worse than Greece&quot; didn&apos;t help for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say that these sharp moves could risk contagion and affect global markets as they would encourage Japanese investors to bring cash home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BOJ will review its quantitative tightening plan at its next policy meeting on June 16-17. If we start to see some intervention or talks of change in tapering, that could weigh on the JPY.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s going to be a boring day on the data front as we just have the UK CPI report on the agenda. The Core CPI Y/Y is expected at 3.6% vs. 3.4% prior, while the Services CPI Y/Y is seen at 4.8% vs. 4.7% prior. Just by looking at these numbers I really can&apos;t understand why the BoE cut rates at the last meeting. They still have a long way to go to sustainably reach their 2% target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing an 87% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting and a total of 41 bps of easing by year-end. As of now, I think there&apos;s a mispricing and the market should expect just one rate cut at most. Higher than expected readings today could trigger such repricing, while lower than expected ones should keep us around two rate cuts by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;16:00 GMT/12:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Barkin (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16:00 GMT/12:00 ET - ECB&apos;s Lane (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19:30 GMT/15:30 ET - ECB&apos;s de Guindos (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Geopolitical
tensions in the Middle East flared after CNN reported that U.S.
intelligence believes Israel is preparing for a potential strike on
Iranian nuclear facilities. The report, based on unnamed
American officials familiar with recent intelligence, suggests that
Israel’s military planning is well underway — though any action
may hinge on the outcome of ongoing nuclear negotiations between
Washington and Tehran. While the report is heavily caveated, the
underlying message from U.S. sources is clear: a strike is a live
possibility. Energy markets reacted swiftly, sending
crude
prices surging
higher. They’ve since had some retracement. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;In
politics we had a unanimous 100–0 vote in the US Senate to pass the
No
Tax on Tips Act,
effectively making all tips tax-free. While the measure is being
framed as a win for service workers, some analysts warn of unintended
consequences. With tips now exempt from taxation, there’s concern
that efforts by workers and unions to push for higher base wages may
lose momentum, as employers shift more compensation into variable,
tip-based income. And since tips were already lightly taxed or often
underreported, the net impact could ironically result in lower
after-tax income for many low-wage workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Staying
in Washington, Politico reports a tentative agreement has been
reached to raise the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to
$40,000 as part of the broader GOP tax package. According to three
Republican lawmakers familiar with the closed-door talks, the deal
marks progress toward finalising the megabill, though some internal
objections remain and further negotiations are expected. While not
yet final, the proposed increase would represent a significant
concession aimed at winning broader support for the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We
had comments from three Fed officials. Cleveland
Fed President Beth Hammack, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly,
and
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. All three signalled caution,
Hammack summing it up by saying the
best course of action for the Federal Reserve right now is to &quot;sit
on our hands&quot; and closely monitor incoming data. Bostic
added that on issues like trade policy, clarity appears to be &quot;moving
further into the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;From
Japan we had trade data for April showing a surprise deficit.
Exports
to US fell
in April for first
time
in four
months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Also in Japan, 30-year and 40-year JGB yields have remained at or close to record highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;China’s
Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) strongly criticised recent US guidance
warning companies against using advanced Chinese semiconductors,
including Huawei’s Ascend AI chips. In a statement, a MOFCOM
spokesperson described the move as a “typical example of unilateral
bullying and protectionism,” accusing Washington of imposing
discriminatory restrictions on Chinese firms. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I’ve
noted the big mover, oil, above. But FX was not quiet. The upshot of
all the developments is a lower US dollar on the session here. All
major FX is higher against the friendless dollar. EUR/USD is up a
solid 50 points while USD/JPY and USD/CHF are down similar. GBP, AUD,
CAD, NZD all higher also. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Gold
has been lacklustre but is near its session high as I update.

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;172&quot; data-end=&quot;417&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Group of Seven (G7) nations are in discussions over coordinated tariff measures targeting low-value Chinese imports, as Western economies grow increasingly wary of what they describe as Beijing’s non-market practices and industrial overcapacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;419&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Canada’s Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne confirmed that talks are underway among G7 members to address the surge in inexpensive Chinese goods, which are often sold through e-commerce platforms at prices that evade traditional tariffs. Champagne  emphasised overcapacity issues and non-market behaviour that he says is distorting global trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;846&quot; data-end=&quot;1295&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The initiative follows recent moves by the United States to revoke the so-called de minimis exemption for certain Chinese e-commerce shipments. Under the previous rules, packages valued under $800 could enter the U.S. without incurring duties. The change, championed by Trump, targets popular platforms such as Temu and Shein, which have been accused of exploiting loopholes to flood Western markets with ultra-cheap goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1297&quot; data-end=&quot;1612&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;European governments are also considering similar measures. France, the UK, and the broader European Union have floated proposals to impose duties or administrative fees on low-value imports, with a focus on re-establishing fair competition for domestic producers and curbing the dominance of Chinese supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The talks signal a coordinated shift among developed economies to counterbalance China’s trade model, which officials argue is increasingly reliant on state-backed overproduction and aggressive pricing strategies across sectors ranging from solar panels to consumer electronics and textiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1907&quot; data-end=&quot;2114&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While concrete action has yet to be finalised, G7 officials suggest that tariffs on small packages could be one of several steps taken to address what they view as a systemic imbalance in global trade flows. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg had this on Tuesday, citing Chinese customs data. I saw April gold imports data earlier this month, but this is more detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China imported the most gold in nearly a year last month, as strong investor demand and central bank policy shifts pushed bullion inflows sharply higher despite record prices.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
According to customs data released Tuesday, gold imports jumped 73% month-on-month to 127.5 metric tons in April — the highest level since May 2024. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market participants attribute the spike in imports to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which is understood to have allocated fresh import quotas to select commercial banks in April. The central bank, which maintains tight control over physical bullion flows, typically issues licenses only to designated institutions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update (weekly candles):&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;News out of Hong Kong ICYMI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;134&quot; data-end=&quot;321&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hong Kong pension fund managers have warned of potential forced selling of US Treasuries after Moody’s downgraded US debt, leaving only one remaining AAA rating from Japan’s R&amp;amp;I agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;496&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Under Hong Kong’s Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) rules, funds can only allocate more than 10% to Treasuries if the US has a AAA or equivalent rating from an approved agency. The four approved agencies are: S&amp;amp;P, Moddy&apos;s, Fitch, and Japan&apos;s Rating &amp;amp; Investment Information (R&amp;amp;I). Only R&amp;amp;I has the US at AAA now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;497&quot; data-end=&quot;620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;499&quot; data-end=&quot;620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The HK Investment Funds Association has urged regulators to make an exception for US Treasuries rated just below AAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;621&quot; data-end=&quot;702&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;623&quot; data-end=&quot;702&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of end-2024, HK$484 billion in bond and mixed asset funds could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;703&quot; data-end=&quot;856&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;705&quot; data-end=&quot;856&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The MPFA acknowledged the issue, confirming the US still qualifies under current rules, but said it will monitor developments and act if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;859&quot; data-end=&quot;980&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hong Kong funds are only one set of funds. If other jurisdictions should follow similar rules (they all do) then forced selling could occur. It won&apos;t be just the US bond markets that is ht. That&apos;s the worry and that&apos;s (one of the reasons, a biggie) why the downgrade matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;859&quot; data-end=&quot;980&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, retail equity buyers are like ....&lt;/p&gt;

But its incremental progress on the bill. If progress is massive deficits and debtl, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More at that link above. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right now the best action for the Fed is to sit on its hands... &quot;&quot;The best action we can take is to sit on our hands and really carefully go through the data, engage with our communities, hear what they are thinking about, hear about the choices that they are making,&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation expectations have stayed reasonably well-anchored, if that changes it might be a signal the Fed needs to act

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP TO APPOINT GEN. GUETLEIN TO LEAD $831B &apos;GOLDEN DOME&apos; MISSILE SHIELD

President Trump plans to name Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein to lead the &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; a new missile defense system aimed at protecting the U.S. from advanced threats like hypersonic weapons and low-flying missiles. The system would blend existing interceptors with satellite-based defenses.

The project could cost up to $831 billion over 20 years, with $25 billion proposed in the next budget. Guetlein, a space and missile defense expert, has warned of growing threats from China and backs increased U.S. space investments.

Trump is pushing for a fast rollout, prioritizing components that can be completed during his term. The &quot;Golden Dome&quot; will combine traditional and emerging defense technologies.</title>
