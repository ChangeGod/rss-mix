The exception was the USDCAD which is ending the day flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest mover was the USDJPY with a fall of -0.83% on the day. The greenback fell -0.59%  vs the CHF and -0.39% vs the AUD. The USD fell -0.17% vs both the EUR and the GBP.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price action was up and down with the dollar lower bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDJPY moved down to the low of a swing area between 143.57 and 143.83. The price is below the 100 hour MA at 143.947, but above the 200 hour MA at 143.45. Both of those MAs will be barometers for the new trading day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AUDUSD moved above the 200 day MA in the Asian Pacific session at 0.6461 and extended up to 0.64936. The price did correct lower to retest the 200 day MA as the clock ticks to the close, but is holding above the key MA level.  That MA will be a key barometer in the new trading day - staying above will have traders looking to extend above the high and the 0.6500 level. Move below, and disappointment on the failed break may start to sink in for some traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both the EURUSD and the GBPUSD, they each had their shots above the 200 hour MA. Each shot missed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the EURUSD, the price moved above it&apos;s 200 hour MA for the 2nd time in 2-days and each time momentum faded after a couple of hours of trading. The price of the EURUSD is closing the day below the 100-hour MA at 1.1330. The 200 hour MA is at 1.1348.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the GBPUSD, it traded above its converged 100/200 hour MAs 1.33238 and failed. The price is trading at 1.3290 going into the close with the 100-hour MA now at 1.33138 and the 200-hour MA at 1.33238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally today, the ISM non-manufacturing came in stronger than expectations. New orders and employment were better, but so was the price data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a summary of the index and the key components&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;126&quot; data-end=&quot;221&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;126&quot; data-end=&quot;221&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;128&quot; data-end=&quot;158&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;ISM Services Index: 51.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;161&quot; data-end=&quot;221&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;161&quot; data-end=&quot;221&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;163&quot; data-end=&quot;221&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Above expectations (50.2) and up from March’s 50.8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;223&quot; data-end=&quot;249&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;250&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;250&quot; data-end=&quot;318&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;252&quot; data-end=&quot;318&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prices Paid: 65.1 (↑ from 60.9) — indicates rising input costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;319&quot; data-end=&quot;387&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;321&quot; data-end=&quot;387&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;New Orders: 52.3 (↑ from 50.4) — expansionary, stronger demand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;388&quot; data-end=&quot;459&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;390&quot; data-end=&quot;459&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Employment: 49.0 (↑ from 46.2) — still contracting, but improving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;460&quot; data-end=&quot;527&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;462&quot; data-end=&quot;527&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Business Activity: 53.7 (↓ from 55.9) — slower pace of growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;528&quot; data-end=&quot;602&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;530&quot; data-end=&quot;602&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Supplier Deliveries: 51.3 (↑ from 50.6) — slightly slower deliveries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;603&quot; data-end=&quot;664&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;605&quot; data-end=&quot;664&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inventories: 53.4 (↑ from 50.3) — stockpiling increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;665&quot; data-end=&quot;728&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;667&quot; data-end=&quot;728&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Backlog of Orders: 48.0 (↑ from 47.4) — still contracting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;729&quot; data-end=&quot;817&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;731&quot; data-end=&quot;817&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;New Export Orders: 48.6 (↑ from 45.8) — export demand improving but still below 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;818&quot; data-end=&quot;880&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;820&quot; data-end=&quot;880&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imports: 44.3 (↓ from 52.6) — sharp drop, contractionary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;881&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inventory Sentiment: 56.1 (↓ from 56.6) — still elevated, but slightly less&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index snapped a 9-day win streak with a modest decline of 36.29 points are -0.64% at 5650.38.

Over the weekend, OPEC+ announced an increase in output and signaled it would continue raising production until Kazakhstan and Iraq comply with curbing excess supply. Despite the bearish headline, the market held above the April low of $55.12, offering a modest sign of resilience. A move below that level, however, could see further liquidation as dip buyers hold onto a short leash near lows for the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is is up $92 or 2.85% at $3332.88.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver rose $0.47 or 1.50% at $32.47&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is little changed at $94276&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market today yields are higher on the day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield is up 1.2 basis points at 3.834%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield is up 2.4 basis points at 3.941%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield is up 3.9 basis points at 4.347%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year is up 5.0 basis points at 4.839%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US Commerce Secretary Lutnick spoke on Fox Business:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Trade with Canada is really complex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn&apos;t see how a Trump-Carney meeting works out perfectly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade deal with Canada is possible, its really complex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutnick laying the foundation for no trade deal announcement with Canada. Kudos to him, a bit of honesty instead of stringing everyone along with b/s. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The high water mark for the S&amp;amp;P index for today was -3.29 points. Getting into positive territory has been a challenge with the current price down -23 points are -0.42% at 5662.5. At session lows, the index was down -52.19 point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still 15 minutes to go in trading but traders seem to be anxious to snap the win streak today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the close Palantir and Ford will report earnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;69&quot; data-end=&quot;501&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Palantir shares are trading down $0.17 (-0.13%) at $124.11. Earlier in the session, the stock reached a high of $125.26, just shy of the all-time high of $125.41 set on February 19. After hitting that record in February, Palantir fell sharply to a low of $66.12, marking a 46.68% decline, before mounting an impressive rebound back to current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;503&quot; data-end=&quot;704&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company is set to report earnings with expectations for EPS of $0.13 and revenue of $862.17 million, compared to $0.08 EPS and $634.34 million in revenue in the same quarter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;492&quot; data-end=&quot;533&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;494&quot; data-end=&quot;533&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;EPS growth: +62.5% year-over-year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;534&quot; data-end=&quot;577&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;536&quot; data-end=&quot;577&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Revenue growth: +35.9% year-over-year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;711&quot; data-end=&quot;975&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ford trades lower ahead of flat earnings forecast
Ford shares are down $0.14 (-1.36%) at $10.14. Earnings are expected to come in unchanged, with revenue forecast at $38.02 billion, versus $0.49 EPS and $42.78 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;1311&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A year ago on earnings day, Ford stock closed at $12.95. It later declined to a low of $8.44 on April 9 before rebounding this past month. On Friday, the stock reached a high of $10.39, nearly matching the $10.40 high from March 27, and just below previous peaks of $10.42 (January 27) and $10.45 (January 21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;610&quot; data-end=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;612&quot; data-end=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;EPS growth: –100% year-over-year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;651&quot; data-end=&quot;695&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;653&quot; data-end=&quot;695&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Revenue decline: –11.1% year-over-year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;139&quot; data-end=&quot;614&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDJPY moved lower in early U.S. trading, finding support near the bottom of a swing area between 143.57 and 143.84, while also holding just above the rising 200-hour moving average, currently at 143.44. The price has since been oscillating around the 100-hour moving average at 143.93, but remains below the 38.2% retracement of the March high to April low move at 144.208—a level it briefly traded above during the Asian and early European sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;616&quot; data-end=&quot;784&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This area represents a tight technical cluster, with the 200-hour MA offering support to the downside and the 38.2% retracement acting as resistance to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;786&quot; data-end=&quot;1087&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last week, the pair surged on Thursday and Friday, breaking through several key targets—including the 100- and 200-hour MAs, the 38.2%, and even the 50% retracement—but ultimately stalled at the falling 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which capped the rally and triggered a move lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1089&quot; data-end=&quot;1394&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, with price back below the 38.2% retracement and indecisive around the 100-hour MA, bearish risks are building. Traders will be watching for a firm move below the 200-hour MA at 143.44 to increase downside potential, while a break back above 144.208 would be needed to restore upside momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has abandoned a plan to convert to a for-profit company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-to-become-public-benefit-corporation-9e7896e0?mod=hp_lead_pos1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to the WSJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is going to be an interesting case, as there is a fair argument it could one day be the most-valuable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet now it&apos;s going to remain a non-profit and seems it&apos;s stuck that way. Now there is a complicated sub-structure that does allow for some profits so it&apos;s tough to weigh in here but it will be an interesting story to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will instead transform its for-profit subsidiary into a public-benefit corporation that is controlled by the nonprofit parent, the company said Monday,&quot; the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, how do you decide where the profits go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find I&apos;m using ChatGPT more and more for everyday questioned that I used to ask google and the voice mode is particularly good. The images lately have been something of a game-changer too, though they&apos;re often just a novelty. The better models and &apos;deep research&apos; function are powerful if you haven&apos;t tried them.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling down $1.16 or -1.99% and $57.13. The low price today reached $55.39. That was just short of the low price from April 9 $55.15. It was the lowest close since February 10, 2021. The daily chart, the next major target below $55.15 is the 61.8% retracement of the move up from the 2020 low. That level comes in $49.44.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;WTI crude oil settled lower by $1.16 to $57.13 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s another down day for crude but oil companies are probably feeling a sigh of relief given that OPEC+ raised production on the weekend and there was a report saying they would continue to add barrels until there was cooperation from Kazakhstan and Iraq on repaying excess barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April low of $55.12 held for now but I strongly suspect there will need to be some good news to get oil moving back higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, it will just take time for the oil market to rebalance. At $55, US oil producers rapidly slow down drilling and with natural decline rates at 20% per year, it doesn&apos;t take long for the barrels to fall off on the supply side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I strongly suspect, the tone of the meeting and comments afterwards will be market moving for the loonie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think anyone is expecting any kind of deal or short-term changes in tariff rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also from Trump:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China wants to make a deal very badly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump says he will meet with film industry officials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he wants to make sure industry is happy with the tariff idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all sounds like a slow walkdown after a wild tweet late last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think this matters at all for markets as even NFLX is barely down but it speaks to a President that&apos;s making policy based on impulse, not a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices are remaining in negative territory although they are off their lowest levels and trading near their highest levels. Nevertheless the S&amp;amp;P index is in jeopardy of snapping it nine-day win streak. The NASDAQ index is the weakest today but only by -0.37%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since bottoming on April 21 at 4835.04, the S&amp;amp;P index reached a high on Friday at 5700.70 or 11.74% from the low. The current price is at 5669.1 or -17.67 points or -0.31%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price last week moved above its 50-day moving average currently at 5575.88. It would take a move below that moving average to disappoint the buyers. On the top side, the next target comes against its 200 day moving average at 5746.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the other major indices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average is up on the day by 40 points or 0.10% at 41357.35&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index is down -62 points are -0.35% at 17915.59.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European equity markets today, the major indices were mixed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +1.12%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Francis, -0.55%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100, +1.17%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spains Ibex, +0.53%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +0.39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Reminder, on Thursday, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said &quot;I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day&quot; on a tariff deal. We&apos;re still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bessent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trading deals maybe as early as this week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m highly confident that 17 trading partners excluding China have presented with very good trade proposals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could see more frictionless trade from these negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could see substantial progress with China in the coming weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market is not pricing in inflation, hard data is still resilient&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, this would all result in very low tariffs between the US and the world but you have to have a great deal of faith to make that call at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;253&quot; data-end=&quot;558&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD buyers had their opportunity to reclaim control with a move above the  converged 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (at 1.33238), but momentum stalled, and the price has since rotated back lower. The failure to stay above those key MAs has shifted short-term control back to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;560&quot; data-end=&quot;761&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support continues to hold above a familiar swing area between 1.3259 and 1.3273, but that zone remains fragile. A confirmed break and hold below it would strengthen the bearish bias going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;1010&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next downside targets come in at the April 23 low of 1.3232, followed by the swing area near 1.3203. A move through those levels would increase downside pressure and potentially open the door toward the 38.2% retracement at 1.3160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1012&quot; data-end=&quot;1152&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the buyers had their shot, it’s the sellers who are now dictating the pace—provided they can push and hold below the key support band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1172&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3325 (200/100-hour MAs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1223&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1225&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3259–1.3273 (swing area), 1.3232 (April 23 low), 1.3203 (next swing area), 1.3160 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>White House: No final decision on film tariffs have been made</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Reporter spoke with a White House spokesman who said that Trump&apos;s talk about tariffs may get walked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/white-house-clarifies-trump-movie-tariff-1236207216/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s initial tweet about it didn&apos;t leave much room for interpretation but the quick climbdown highlights that everything in this administration is made up as they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be the first tariff on a service, which is a dangerous game for the US to play because it has a huge trade surplus in services globally and virtually all of the major US tech companies are services exporters in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
