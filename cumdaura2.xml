                            &lt;p&gt;The major European indices closed mixed on the day. Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB closed down -1.20% at 40166.76. The move to the downside took the price off the highest level going back to 2008 for the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX rose 0.71% and closed at a new record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the closing level shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax Rose 167.65 points or 0.71% at 23935.09&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC felt -3.07 points or -0.04% at 7883.63.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 rose 14.74 points or 0.17% at 8699.31.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex rose 34.50 points or 0.25% at 14099.00.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB fell -489.51 or -1.20% at 40166.76.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As London/European traders had for the exits, US stocks are rebounding from lower levels. The Dow industrial average is currently positive on the day. The S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices are&apos;s marginally lower but well off lows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial Average up 24.66 points or 0.06% at 42678. The Index was down -317.03 points at session allows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -10.7 points or -0.18% at 5947.70. The Index was down -62.69 points at session lows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index minus 69.5.2 or -0.36% at 19141.10. The Index was down -273.68 points at session lows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading up $0.58 or 0.94% at $62.55. The price is near the high for the day at $62.67.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading up $28.32 or 0.89% at $3230.17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $1747 at $104,771&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields have come off their high levels. The 30 year yield was back about 5% earlier in the day. It is now back below the key level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.993%, +1.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5- year yield 4.096%, +3.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.496%, +5.6 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.962%, +6.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fed&apos;s Williams (speaking to reporters?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty has led the Fed to keep interest rates steady so far this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path forward might not become clearer for months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s not going to be that in June, we&apos;re going to understand what&apos;s happening more in July&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s going to be a process of collecting data, getting a better picture, and watching those things develop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) $MSFT - CHATGPT SEES WEAKER MOMENTUM AMONG OLDER USERS THAN META AI, GEMINI

 As generative AI adoption continues to ramp up, ChatGPT is still the top pick for teens and young adults, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. But for 25-34 year olds, there appears to be greater variety, with adoption roughly the same across ChatGPT, Google&apos;s Gemini and Meta AI, the analysts said. Meanwhile for older age groups, ChatGPT usage is largely flat in the last six months, while its competitors have notched gains, they said. Gemini has shown the strongest momentum overall, garnering the biggest daily and monthly active user gains, they said.</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;71&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD is under pressure to start the new trading week, with sellers regaining more control following last weeks rejection of the 200-day moving average (green line currently at 1.40144). The pair had stalled near that level on two separate times last week, leading to renewed downside interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;71&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After trading above and below the 100-hour moving average (blue line currently at 1.39582), the price today has now fallen back below both that 100-hour and also the 200-hour moving averages (now at 1.39347), tilting the near-term bias more bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;810&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is now targeting the swing area between 1.38917 and 1.3904, which served as resistance earlier in April before breaking higher on May 8 and forming a floor.  That area could act as support on more selling and a retest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;810&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below that zone would open the door to further downside, with the next technical support seen near the 1.3860 region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;812&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;838&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;838&quot; data-end=&quot;953&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;840&quot; data-end=&quot;953&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.39347 (200-hour MA), 1.39582 (100-hour MA), 1.40097–1.40268 (swing area and the 200-day MA and daily resistance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;954&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;956&quot; data-end=&quot;1009&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38917–1.3904 (swing area), then 1.38607&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1011&quot; data-end=&quot;1173&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are more in control while price holds below the key hourly moving averages. A move back above the 100-hour MA would be needed to ease the downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;94&quot; data-end=&quot;389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is starting the week on stronger footing, benefiting from broad U.S. dollar weakness following Friday’s Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;391&quot; data-end=&quot;700&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, the AUDUSD has extended above both the 100-hour (0.64228) and 200-hour (0.64327) moving averages, signaling a more bullish bias in the short term.  The price has been waffling above and below those MAs as the price action consolidates near highs for the year (and going back to November 2024 - not shown). The pair is also currently testing the 200-day moving average at 0.64558, a critical hurdle for further upside momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;702&quot; data-end=&quot;963&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the bullish tone strengthening, traders are now eyeing the next resistance zone between 0.6493 and 0.65135—the upper extreme from earlier in 2025. A break above that area would mark a key technical victory and open the path to broader upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;965&quot; data-end=&quot;989&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.64327 (200-hour MA), 0.64228 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.64558 (200-day MA), then 0.6493–0.65135 (2025 high area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1279&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Holding above the rising moving averages keeps the buyers in control, with a close above the 200-day MA likely to encourage further bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

However, Oracle (ORCL) remains nearly flat with a minimal gain of 0.04%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💡 Semiconductors: Challenges continue as Nvidia (NVDA) marks a 0.26% drop and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slips by 2.02%, pointing to ongoing volatility in this critical subsector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🚗 Consumer Cyclical: Tesla (TSLA) experiences a sharp decline of 3.04%, intensifying concerns over the auto manufacturer&apos;s performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏦 Financials: Visa (V) shows resilience with a 0.71% rise, contrasting JPMorgan Chase&apos;s (JPM) slight dip of 0.11%. Bank of America (BAC) is up 0.47%, contributing to mixed sentiments in this sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🩺 Healthcare: AstraZeneca (AZN) rockets up by 2.81%, while Eli Lilly (LLY) shows a notable drop of 0.95%, emphasizing the variability within the sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market sentiment reflects a cautious optimism mingled with sector-specific concerns. Tech&apos;s marginal gains underscore investor interest, but the downturn in energy and consumer cyclical sectors suggests brewing caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall in semiconductor stocks aligns with broader tech concerns, driven possibly by global supply chain disruptions and regulatory issues. The bleak performance in energy, with companies like Chevron (CVX) down 2.67%, hints at fluctuating oil prices influencing investor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering today&apos;s varied market dynamics, diversification remains key. Investors are advised to watch tech stocks like Microsoft for potential gains amidst volatility and consider rebalancing portfolios to offset energy sector risks. The healthcare sector&apos;s fluctuations suggest cautious observation, particularly with strong performers like AstraZeneca. Keep an eye on value stocks in financials to hedge against instability, and check regularly for updates on ForexLive.com for comprehensive insights, especially in these rapidly shifting markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;84&quot; data-end=&quot;237&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF is trading weaker to start the week as the U.S. dollar faces broad pressure following Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit late Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;239&quot; data-end=&quot;491&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, Friday’s rally attempt failed to hold above the 100-hour moving average (blue line), and sellers have since taken the pair below the 200-hour moving average (green line) at 0.83496. That level now acts as close resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;493&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, today’s low found buyers within a key swing area between 0.8318 and 0.8333—a former ceiling that is now serving as a support floor. Traders will look to that zone for clues about the next directional move. Holding above it keeps the door open for a retest of resistance; a break below would open the path toward the next lower target area near 0.8272.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;867&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;939&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;939&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8349 (200-hour MA), 0.8375 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;940&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;942&quot; data-end=&quot;990&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8318–0.8333 (swing area), then 0.8272 to 0.8280 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1072&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum favors sellers, but watch the 0.8318–0.8333 floor for signs of a shift.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fund managers haven&apos;t felt the FOMO yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All year, retail investors have been piling into stocks while fund managers have lightened up. With the huge rebound in stocks, many fund managers are no doubt wishing they had bought the dip but the latest survey from Bank of America shows they&apos;ve remained cautious, with allocations to US equities at the lowest since May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of that might be trickling abroad as several global stock markets hit records last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t argue with the success retail has had in the past month but in the long history of retail vs institutional, it&apos;s almost always best to be on the institutional side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US stock indices are opening lower after the Moody&apos;s downgrade in other weekend news. The White House is stripping about other deals. China is upset about Chip restrictions. Israel is not looking to peace.  Russia&apos;s Putin is not cooperating. US House comes to a agreement on the budget deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market 4 minutes into the open agent showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -210.06 points or -0.49% at 42444.68.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P Annex -53.36 points are -0.95% at 5905.02&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -239.66 points or -5.25% at 18971.45.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index 5-day win streak is in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of some of the big names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;48&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2&quot; data-end=&quot;48&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Broadcom (AVGO): $226.56, ▼2.06 (-0.90%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;49&quot; data-end=&quot;108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;51&quot; data-end=&quot;108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Super Micro Computer (SMCI): $45.09, ▼1.06 (-2.30%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;109&quot; data-end=&quot;153&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;111&quot; data-end=&quot;153&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Intel (INTC): $21.21, ▼0.45 (-2.08%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;154&quot; data-end=&quot;215&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;215&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): $114.88, ▼2.30 (-1.96%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;216&quot; data-end=&quot;272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;218&quot; data-end=&quot;272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon (AMZN): $203.73, ▼1.86 (-0.90%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;320&quot; data-end=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple (AAPL): $205.13, ▼6.13 (-2.91%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;366&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;368&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meta Platforms (META): $633.25, ▼7.09 (-1.11%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;421&quot; data-end=&quot;470&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;423&quot; data-end=&quot;470&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Microsoft (MSFT): $455.32, ▲1.05 (+0.23%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;471&quot; data-end=&quot;520&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;473&quot; data-end=&quot;520&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL): $165.25, ▼0.94 (-0.57%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;521&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;523&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adobe (ADBE): $416.44, ▼0.69 (-0.16%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;567&quot; data-end=&quot;611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;569&quot; data-end=&quot;611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nvidia (NVDA): $134.04, ▼1.36 (-1.00%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;FOMC Gov. Jefferson is speaking and says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The impact of tariffs on the Fed&apos;s mandate is top of mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risks to the Fed&apos;s mandates depends on policy choices by the administration that have not been made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are risks to both jobs and inflation, but given uncertainty it is appropriate to wait and see on right decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US could face a one-time increase in the price level tariffs, need to be sure that does not become a sustained increase in inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will keep policy in place to be sure inflation expectations remain anchored&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far the labor market has been very resilient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is too early to tell how the labor market will be affected by administration policies &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no active conversations about changing the ample reserve operations framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked about the Moody&apos;s downgrade, says that is trying to fulfill its price and jobs mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downgrade will be treated the same as other incoming data, with focus on implications for jobs and inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Everyone is downplaying the Moody&apos;s downgrade  as either late or irrelevant but I&apos;ll take the other side of that. In fact, what bothers me is that so many people in the administration and Congress are downplaying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a truly AAA-rated country, when there is a downgrade, there is a reckoning. I don&apos;t see that at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment is something of a fork in the road with Republicans in a position to reign in US spending while also dialing down the &apos;ask&apos; on tax cuts. Instead, the US seems to be gripped (on all sides) by an idea that if there aren&apos;t going to be any brakes, then they might as well step on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market isn&apos;t happy today with US 30-year yields up 13 bps and in danger of breaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are some real fiscal hawks left in Congress and this is the rallying point but yesterday the House Budget Committee that grandstanded on Friday promptly approved the bill 17-16 along party lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those conservatives have insisted that Medicaid work requirements take 
effect immediately and that the clean energy tax credits be eliminated 
sooner,&quot; NBC News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/key-house-committee-advances-trump-agenda-bill-conservatives-rcna207555&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone think this bill won&apos;t pass?&lt;/p&gt;

Trump has said that they Ukraine Russia war would never have happened if he was in charge, and that he would end the war quickly.  It apparently is not as easy as he thought.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;New York Fed president John Williams is speaking to the Mortgage Bankers Association in New York City. Williams is a permanent voting member on the Federal Reserve Board:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent economic data has been very good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labor market is pretty much in balance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First quarter growth was unusual trade issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Inflation has been coming down slowly and gradually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keyword for economy is uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monetary policy is in a good place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed rate policy is well-positioned. It is slightly restrictive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some forward-looking indicators are signaling concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade is particular point of uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many firms and households are in a wait-and-see mode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed has a ways to go in shrinking its balance sheet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance sheet drawdown not affecting market prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dollar remains the world&apos;s reserve currency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global investors associate USS place to invest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are not seeing major changes in investor interest in treasury bonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core fixed income markets have been functioning really well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers are still in good shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeing some signs and data of rising consumer caution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The economy is likely to slow this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is going to take some time to get read on economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed can take it time on monetary policy decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs potentially raise inflation and unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments remain balanced as a Fed awaits the impact from tariffs mainly. When the keyword is &quot;uncertainty&quot;, they Fed is on hold until they get the next shove from the economy.   He does warn that the economy is likely to slow, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the premarket for US stocks still remain negative: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -233.74 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -58.63 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -290 point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US debt market at 9 AM ET: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.025%, +4.2 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.147%, +8.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.562%, +2.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 5.032%, +13.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;There was a report in the FT last week indicating that US-Japan trade negotiations were on hold and would likely stay that way through the July Japanese elections. Kowtowing to the US ahead of July elections would be deeply unpopular in Japan and it looks like they&apos;re going to punt until afterwards, even at the risk of rising reciprocal tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox Business&apos; Charlie Gasparino has repeatedly said a Japan agreement was close but now he&apos;s reporting that&apos;s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The US-Japan trade agreement framework is being delayed in part over negotiations over so-called burden sharing, or how much money Japan has to kick in to support US military in Japan (also known as protection from Chinese aggression)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there might be a deal to be made around military spending and investment in Alaska LNG but it&apos;s tough to get there unless the US is willing to take tariffs to zero. There was also an interesting report this weekend via Bloomberg suggesting that China got a better deal by punching back and that could be the playbook now.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is lower to start the trading week as investors sell US stocks, bonds after the Moody&apos;s downgrade of US debt late Friday.  The USD is down -0.90% vs the EUR, and -0.81% vs the GBP. to start the session The greenback is down -0.42% vs the JPY. The video above outlines the technical levels in play for those three major currency pairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you likely know already, the rating agency Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating on Friday from Aaa to Aa1, citing the nation’s soaring $36 trillion debt and persistent fiscal deficits. The move, which comes after similar downgrades by other agencies a year of so ago, signals growing concern over America’s long-term fiscal outlook and rising interest costs. While Moody’s shifted its outlook from “negative” to “stable,” the downgrade sparked backlash from Trump allies, who criticized the decision as politically motivated. The change could complicate President Trump’s efforts to cut taxes and balance the budget, especially as investors remain unconvinced by revenue-raising tariffs and cost-cutting measures. The announcement sent Treasury yields higher after the market close, raising the risk of bond market instability when trading resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhiile, the House panel approved the Trump Tax cut plan. That will lead to a vote this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Fed,  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic this morning on CNBC warned that Moody’s downgrade could have wide-reaching effects across the economy and financial markets, particularly by raising the cost of capital and introducing greater uncertainty. He emphasized that it may take several months to fully understand the impact on U.S. debt demand and inflation from tariffs. Bostic noted the Fed is cautious on rate cuts, leaning toward just one this year due to the complex interplay of inflation, tariffs, and economic sentiment. While markets are functioning well, inflation remains above target and expectations are moving in a troubling way, although firms aren’t planning large layoffs. He highlighted a disconnect between economic sentiment and data and pointed to potential ripple effects from even reduced tariffs on China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In geopolitical news, Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich stated that Israel aims to continue the war to push Gaza’s population southward and potentially out of the territory, according to Sky News Arabia. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take full control of Gaza, while Israeli forces expanded ground operations and conducted airstrikes that killed at least 100 people. Israel&apos;s government also said it would allow limited humanitarian aid into Gaza to prevent a hunger crisis. Pres. Trump said on Friday a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month in Gaza, but warned that something bad would happen if Iran does not move in nuclear talks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ukraine stated that Kyiv prioritizes a ceasefire in its ongoing discussions with the Russian delegation and is open to exploring a potential meeting between President Zelensky and President Putin. This aligns with earlier remarks from U.S. President Trump, who expressed willingness to meet with both leaders once arrangements are made. Attention now turns to determining the specific timing of any such meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are lower with the futures implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures implying a decline of -258 point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures are implying a decline of -63 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures are implying a decline of -311 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets, the major indices are mixed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, unchange&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.68%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, -0.36%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.24% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, -1.80%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are higher after the Moody&apos;s downgrade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.025%, +4.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.131%, +6.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.536%, +9.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 5.007%, +11.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil down $0.57 or -0.90% at $61.41&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver up $0.32 or 1.01% at $32.60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is up $40.62 or 1.27% at $3242.41&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $3790 at $102,719&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian dollar is lagging today and a portion of that is likely due to the local holiday. Canadian markets are closed today for Victoria Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also an unofficial holiday for the large part of the country that can&apos;t stand the Toronto Maple Leafs as they were routed in a playoff elimination game yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

The most notable ones have been the US Dollar and the long term US Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback got beaten up hour after hour as the session progressed. It&apos;s been particularly weak against the EUR and GBP where the positive news on the &quot;EU-UK reset deal&quot; were likely a contributing factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US bond market, long term Treasury yields continued to rise following the Moody&apos;s downgrade with the newswires reporting on every bps increase after the US 30 year yield crossed the 5% level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Bitcoin erased all the weekend gains as it followed the US stock market lower. And in the last part of the session, we got Fed&apos;s Bostic repeating that his base case remains one rate cut in 2025 as he&apos;s worrying about the inflation part of the mandate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the calendar is still empty on the data front but we will have more Fed speakers sharing their views. Fed&apos;s Williams in particular could be important. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moody&apos;s downgrade will cut across economics, financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downgrade will have implications for cost of capital, could ripple through economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will have to wait and see about impact of downgrade on demand for US debt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fed will have to determine how the downgrade effects an outlook that is already in flux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s unclear if consumers today can take on the full cost of tariffs given the state of household balance sheets, recent inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have to wait 3-6 months to see how uncertainty settles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of rate cuts this year depends on how things turn out, the details of the tariffs will matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaning more towards only one cut this year because it will take time to understand tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a scenario where tariffs become less of a story over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the tariff transition is longer, it may impact consumer behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treasury markets are functioning quite well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation not moving to target as fast as anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty means there is higher risk, the Fed only controls one part of the price of capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As things get more expensive, it changes the choices policymakers, households and businesses face, that will influence the path of the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have not seen much movement on the jobs side, firms say they don&apos;t have plans for large layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation expectations are moving in a troubling way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worry a lot about the inflation side of out mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right now see more risk of higher inflation than the employment side of the mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decline in sentiment is not yet playing out in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May be at a point where the distance between sentiment and data starts to narrow; inventory rundown may be nearing an end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market volatility in April did not feel that close to a significant financial event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volatility reflected people adjusting to new expectations, information about tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even the reduced tariffs on China are economically significant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bostic is a hawk and he&apos;s not a voting member in 2025. He&apos;s been supporting just one rate cut this year as he&apos;s placing more weight on the inflation side of the mandate given that inflation hasn&apos;t moved to target as fast as anticipated. He&apos;s also worrying about inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK and EU also agree security and defence partnership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The partnership paves way for UK firms to access EU&apos;s 150bln pound defence fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sanitary and phytosanitary deal has no time limit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Closer co-operation on emissions trading systems will mean UK businesses not hit by EU carbon tax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK economy to add nearly 9 bln pounds by 2040 as a result of deals on food and drink, emissions trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deal will protect British steel exports from new EU rules and tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK and EU to discuss access to EU facial image databases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Britsh holidaymakers will be able to use more passport e-gates in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK and EU agree to co-operate on youth mobility scheme, scheme will be capped and time-limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is good news for the UK economy, although I don&apos;t think the market is focused on this right now.
