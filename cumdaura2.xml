                            &lt;p&gt;FXIFY, the oldest broker-backed prop firm, is proud to celebrate
its second anniversary, marking two years of industry-defining innovation,
trader-first policies, and rapid global growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, FXIFY has paid out over $30 million to
its traders and now serves a global community of more than 200,000 active
users. In the first quarter of this year alone, a single trader received an
impressive $81,000 payout — a clear demonstration of the firm’s reliability and
commitment to delivering on payout promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t create FXIFY to follow the crowd,” says Peter
Brown, Co-Founder of FXIFY. “We built it to fix what was broken. Traders were
being strung along with gimmicks and delays. So we brought in real
infrastructure, cut out the nonsense, and gave traders something they could
actually rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FXIFY has led a shift in the industry by prioritising
transparency, efficiency, and speed. As the first and oldest broker-backed prop
firm, FXIFY introduced clear evaluation models and first payouts on demand
whilst eliminating common prop firm pain points like vague rules, delayed
payments, and inconsistent policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform supports multiple trading platforms familiar
to traders worldwide and offers flexible account structures suited to every
style and level. From instant funding programs to futures trading and classic
evaluation models, FXIFY has built an ecosystem that gives traders what they
need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its short history, FXIFY has already secured recognition
from International Business Magazine and ForexProp Reviews, among others, for
its outstanding contribution to the prop trading space. The firm’s highest
single payout to date stands at $117,000. One trader has successfully received
over 40 payouts — each one delivered on time — while another holds the title of
FXIFY’s longest continuously funded trader, with a duration of over 1 year and
7 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This performance is powered by a growing team of more than
100 staff across four international offices. With over two decades of combined
experience in both retail and institutional trading, FXIFY’s leadership team
brings industry knowledge and operational stability. That experience translates
into better trading infrastructure, faster response times, and a platform that
understands the real-world needs of traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, FXIFY plans to roll out new and enhanced
trading programs and introduce additional platform integrations. The firm is
also building strategic third-party partnerships and expanding payment options
to deliver a smoother, more powerful user experience.“We’re deeply thankful for
our trading community&apos;s trust and support,” says Peter Brown. “Our traders have
driven our growth, and we’re excited to continue this journey together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it enters year three, FXIFY continues to set the pace
for the industry — transforming what traders expect from a prop firm. With a
foundation of real infrastructure, fast payouts, and proven expertise, FXIFY is
not just keeping up with the market. It’s raising the bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About FXIFY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FXIFY
(https://fxify.com/) is the industry’s oldest broker-backed prop firm,
empowering talented traders globally with access to trading capital. Offering a
comprehensive range of funded trader programs — including Instant Funding,
Futures-funded trading, and various evaluation models — FXIFY enables traders
to showcase their skills, earn up to a 90% Performance Split, and access
capital up to $400,000 with flexible, on-demand payout options.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;183&quot; data-end=&quot;445&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the EURUSD saw a bullish attempt as price moved above the 50% retracement level at 1.13183, but buyers failed to hold the break, turning momentum back toward the downside in the short term. That failure gave sellers a renewed edge, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;447&quot; data-end=&quot;832&quot;&gt;The pair is now approaching a key technical confluence area between 1.1258 and 1.12754. This zone has played a pivotal role recently—acting first as a floor, then as a ceiling, and now potentially a floor again. Within this range lies the rising 100-hour moving average and the broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the April high —adding further weight to its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;1132&quot;&gt;A hold above this support cluster keeps the pair in a neutral-to-bullish posture - negating the failure above the 50% retracement.  That potentially sets the stage for another upside attempt. However, a break below 1.1258 would shift the bias more clearly back to the downside, exposing further support levels at 1.1215 (the 200 hour MA) and a swing area between 1.11899 to 1.1213.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1134&quot; data-end=&quot;1158&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.13183 (50% Fib), 1.1362 (highs from yesterday), 1.1378 (61.8% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1217&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;Support: 1.1258–1.12754 (key zone), 1.12157 (rising 200 hour MA), 1.11899 to 1.1213 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1402&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum is turning, and how price behaves around 1.1258–1.12754 will be critical in determining the next directional move/bias.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) KRAKEN TO LAUNCH TOKENIZED U.S. STOCKS FOR GLOBAL USERS

Kraken, a U.S.-based crypto exchange, will soon let non-U.S. users trade tokenized versions of popular U.S. stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. These digital tokens, called xStocks, will trade 24/7 on the Solana blockchain, offering global investors easier and cheaper access to U.S. equities.

Key Details:
🔸 Launching in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in the coming weeks.
🔸 Not available to U.S. users.
🔸 Over 50 stocks and ETFs will be tokenized, including SPY and SPDR Gold Shares.
🔸 Tokens will be backed by actual shares, held by Kraken’s partner Backed Finance, and redeemable for cash.
🔸 Tokens can be held in digital wallets or used as collateral for crypto trades.

Why Tokenize Stocks?
Kraken says this allows 24/7 trading and avoids high fees and delays typical of international brokerage systems. Investors may eventually trade xStocks on other crypto platforms.</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;168&quot; data-end=&quot;433&quot;&gt;The USDCHF found solid support yesterday at a key swing area near 0.81931 to 0.82120, a zone that had previously acted as a launchpad during the early May rally. Buyers leaned against that level yesterday, halting the recent downside momentum and triggering a bounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;435&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot;&gt;Today, the pair is moving modestly higher and is now testing a higher resistance zone — the swing area between 0.8272 and 0.82803. This level has been a recurring pivot in recent weeks (see red circles), with both buyers and sellers using it as a battleground. A break above this area would open the door toward the 100-hour MA (blue line currently near 0.8308) and the 38.2% retracement level of the May range at 0.83087.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;1092&quot;&gt;Staying below 0.82803 keeps the near-term bias more neutral-to-bearish, especially as the price remains under the 100 hour MA, the 38.2% retracement and the downward sloping trendline. Conversely, a break above the current resistance zone could shift momentum further in favor of the bulls but with those targets looming above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1094&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1168&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1121&quot; data-end=&quot;1168&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8257(50% retracement). 0.8193 to 0.8212 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1169&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1171&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8272–0.82803 (current test), 0.8308 (100 hour MA, and 38.2% Fib), 0.83509 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1372&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is at a pivotal juncture — the response at current levels will help define the next directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 51.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing 52.3 vs 50.1 expected -- best one-month jump since June 2022&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior manufacturing was 50.7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite 52.1 vs 51.2 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rise in
inventories of purchases was the largest recorded in
the 18-year survey history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a nice rebound into solidly positive territory, no doubt due to lower tariffs and a rebound in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is worrisome, though not that surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Average prices charged for goods and services jumped
higher in May, rising at a rate not witnessed since
August 2022. An especially steep rise was seen for manufacturers’
selling prices, which posted the largest monthly
increase since September 2022. Charges levied for
services rose to the greatest extent since April 2023
The latest rise in output prices was overwhelmingly
linked to tariffs, having directly driven up the cost of
imported inputs or caused suppliers to pass through
tariff-related cost increases. Manufacturing input costs
rose at the sharpest rate since August 2022 while
service sector costs rose at the fastest rate since June
2023&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is Chris Williamson,
Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Business confidence has improved in May from the
worrying slump seen in April, with gloom about prospects
for the year ahead lifting somewhat thanks largely to the
pause on higher rate tariffs. Current output growth has
also picked up from April’s recent low, which had seen
the weakest rise for over one-and-a-half years, in
response to an upturn in demand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“However, both sentiment and output growth remain
relatively subdued, and at least some of the upturn in
May can be linked to companies and their customers seeking to front-run further possible tariff-related
issues, most notably the potential for future tariff hikes
after the 90-day pause lapses in July. In particular,
concerns over tariff-related supply shortages and price
rises led to the largest accumulation of input inventories
recorded since survey data were first available 18 years
ago.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Supply chain delays are now more prevalent than at any
time since the pandemic led to widespread shortages in
2022, and prices charged for both goods and services
have spiked higher as firms and their suppliers seek to
pass on tariff levies to customers. The overall rise in
prices charged for goods and services in May was the
steepest since August 2022, which is indicative of
consumer price inflation moving sharply higher.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>US stock futures flat. Urban Outfitters upbeat on the consumer</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Stocks appear to be keying off the dip in Treasury yields. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now flat after a 30 point round trip in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bounce comes after US 30-year yields backed off the 2023 high of 5.17% and are down to 5.11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One good sign I would note in the pre-market movers is Urban Outfitters, which is up +17% after strong earnings and revenue beat. The clothing company highlighted a strong consumer in something of a pushback to the weakness at Target yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the noise in the headlines and the broader economic uncertainty, our customers continued to show resilience in Q1. We haven&apos;t seen any signs of a demand slowdown,&quot; said Richard Hayne, CEO. “May to date, we see the comp sales being very similar to the Q1 print.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company left its guidance unchanged and anticipates 10% global tariffs with 30% from China. The company said it was &quot;definitely considering&quot; raising prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some other pre-market movers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advance Auto Parts +30% on smaller-than-expected loss and revenue beat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nike +1% after announcing return to Amazon and price hikes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humana -6% on Medicare Advantage audit concerns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CVS Health -4% on Medicare audit news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UnitedHealth -3% on Medicare audit news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analog Devices +3% after beating Q2 earnings and revenue estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lumen Technologies +9% after AT&amp;amp;T deal for fiber business&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AT&amp;amp;T flat on Lumen acquisition news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snowflake +8% after earnings beat and strong guidance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunrun -30% on Republican tax bill impact on clean energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enphase, SolarEdge -17%, Array -10%, Nextracker -4%, First Solar -1% on solar sector selloff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zoom -1% despite earnings beat and solid forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pitney Bowes +9% after naming Kurt Wolf as new CEO&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;114&quot; data-end=&quot;477&quot;&gt;The USDCAD broke above a key resistance level at 1.3904 on May 8, marking the end of a multi-week consolidation range. Two days later, the pair tested the 200-day moving average near 1.4015, a critical technical barrier. Sellers leaned against that level on back-to-back sessions, preventing a sustained breakout and triggering a reversal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;479&quot; data-end=&quot;845&quot;&gt;By May 14, the price had fallen back to retest the former breakout point at 1.3904. What had served as a ceiling turned into a floor — temporarily. However, that floor gave way in yesterday’s session, with the pair falling back into the prior consolidation zone between 1.37497 and 1.3904, where price had been trapped from April 16 to May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;847&quot; data-end=&quot;1014&quot;&gt;Now, the old support at 1.3904 has reestablished itself as resistance. As long as the pair stays below 1.3904, the bias remains tilted to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1016&quot; data-end=&quot;1425&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, watch 1.38607 for near-term support. This level marked swing highs on May 1, was broken on May 8 during the upside breakout, and acted as a launchpad for the May highs (as indicated by the green circles). In the current session, the latest bounce also stalled at that level. A move below 1.38607 could invite more selling pressure and further bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar found some modest bids after initial jobless claims edged lower. The reading of 227K was slightly below the 230K consensus and 229K last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no sign of weakening in the US jobs market in the weekly data and that&apos;s likely to firm the Fed&apos;s resolve to wait before cutting rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar rose afterwards, climbing around a dozen pips against the yen, with the euro falling by a similar margin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market was another likely culprit. US 30-year yields tested the 2023 high of 5.17% just ahead of the data and reached 5.16% before pulling back a couple basis points. That may have eased some angst about runaway borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 2023 high breaks, US long-term borrowing costs will be the highest since 2007 and that will be a tough blow for the housing market in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

That is the highest level since Feb 12. The high yield for the year was up at 4.809% back on January 13. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is mixed, but little changed vs the 3 major currency pairs to kickstart the US session .  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the major pairs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EURUSD is down -0.16% (higher USD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USDJPY is also down by -0.26% (lower USD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GBPUSD is unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest mover is the NZDUSD which has taken a tumble in the European morning session and is now down -0.59% (higher USD). The AUDUSD is down -0.20% (higher USD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the Tax and Spending Reconciliation Bill by a 215–214 vote, with Republicans Massie and Davidson voting against it and HFC Chair Harris abstaining by voting &quot;Present.&quot; Representatives Schweikert and Garbarino did not vote. The legislation now heads to various Senate committees and will eventually be debated and voted on in the full Senate—a process expected to take several weeks. If it passes, former President Trump will have his big beautiful bill, but will the markets like it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US yields are voting and it is not supportive.  On the longer end, yields moved up double digits yesterday with the yield curve steepening sharply. Looking at the treasury curve, the yield curve is steeper again with the 2-year down -2.7 basis points, while the 10 year is up 1.6 basis points. The 2-10 year spread is up to 62.5 basis points, just a few basis points from the 64.8 basis point recent high (and highest level since January 2022) reached on April 21.  The snapshot shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.990%, -2.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.142%, -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.612%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 yar yield 5.144%, +5.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US stock indices, the earlier pre-market gains are being eroded fast with the Nasdaq moving from about +40 points to down -92 points over just the last hour of trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow dow -221 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P down -28 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq -92 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is down -$1.00 at $60.63. OPEC+ is discussing an increase in production for July. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is down -$5.13 or -0.14% at $3312.60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is up $1000 at $110,704. A new record high was reached $111,888 before a modest rotation lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markets are watching fiscal policy and have concerns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markets are looking for more fiscal discipline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed won&apos;t buy bonds in primary auctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard data shows economy doing quite well, scant sign of tariff impact so far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If tariffs are closer to 10%, then economy is good shape for 2H.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If tariffs settle down, Fed could be in position to cut in later part of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much more optimistic now relative to last month on tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very hopeful the current path of administration is a good one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firms are pausing but not cancelling plans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue to believe tariffs will be a one time price increase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standard Fed playbook is to look through one time price impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn&apos;t see much from tariffs to drive inflation persistently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone in markets expected more fiscal restraint from tax bill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As long as economy gets back on good path, could reinvigorate demand for US assets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shouldn&apos;t be new to those who read his April speech where he laid out his two scenarios. His scenario where tariffs settle around 10% on average or less is playing out, so he is less inclined to cut immediately and will wait for the second part of the year (which is still bad for long term bonds as inflation concerns remain high).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members expressed increased confidence that inflation would return to target over the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members attached a higher probability to the possibility that the trade shock would be inflationary beyond the short term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased confidence that inflation would return to target in line with the March baseline projections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This pointed to upside risks to inflation in the medium to long term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty, the appreciation of the Euro and the decline in oil and gas prices, would further dampen the inflation outlook in the near term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A cut at the present meeting could be seen as frontloading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few members noted that they could have felt comfortable with a 50 basis point rate cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market-based indicators pointed to a tightening of financial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wanted to avoid the perception that the neutral level of interest rates was the end point of the current cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinflation to dominate in short term due to Euro.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Euro Area had built up some resistance to shocks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Euro seem to turn into safe-haven currency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Inflation was expected to hover close to the inflation target of 2% for the remainder of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the equivalent of the FOMC Meeting Minutes. It&apos;s not a market moving release and the data is stale by the time it gets released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full accounts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2025/html/ecb.mg250522~31b2c664d4.en.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The data was overall disappointing but there were some glimpse of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main event was the US House vote on Trump&apos;s tax bill which passed and sent long term Treasury yields to new highs. The US 30yr yield is now close to the 2023 high. US indices reacted positively to the news but eventually gave everything back. The US Dollar weakened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the focus will switch to the US Flash PMIs where business sentiment and inflation details will be scanned. The market is pricing 51 bps of easing for the Fed in 2025 but that could be lowered with good economic data or lack of progress on inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Powerful Reversal Pattern: Mastering the Head &amp; Shoulders Pattern- Trusted by FBS Analysts</title>

      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/powerful-reversal-pattern-mastering-the-head-shoulders-pattern-trusted-by-fbs-analysts-20250522/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The
Head and Shoulders pattern is an important pattern that is frequently used in
technical analysis and signals a potential trend change in the market. The head
and shoulders pattern appears at the end of an uptrend. This pattern consists
of three peaks that form in sequence. The first and third peaks are called the
‘shoulders’, while the highest peak in the middle is called the ‘head’. The
formation appears at the end of an uptrend and gives us signals that the price
may reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is the Head and Shoulders Pattern
formed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Head and Shoulders pattern consists of the left shoulder, head and right
shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
First Shoulder (Left Shoulder): Prices initially continue a historical uptrend,
reach a peak, and then experience a slight pullback. This is not a scary drop
at first, but a minor correction.

Head: After the correction is over, prices rise again and form a new high that
exceeds the first shoulder. This high forms the head of the formation and is
usually the highest point. Up until this stage, there is no indication that the
price will turn down.

Second Shoulder (Right): Prices start to fall again after the head and then
turn back up from the previous low to form a second peak. This peak is usually
near the level of the first shoulder and does NOT break through the highest
peak formed by the head.

Neckline: The line connecting the lowest points between the two shoulders is
called the neckline. Breaking this line indicates that the Head and Shoulders
formation is complete and a downtrend may begin.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to trade this pattern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1 - Identify the Pattern Formation: One of the trickiest parts of
trading a head and shoulders pattern is identifying the pattern as it forms.
The shoulders may not be symmetrical, making it more difficult to spot the
pattern. There are two things to keep in mind when looking for a head and
shoulders pattern. First, these patterns require an existing uptrend. Without a
strong uptrend, there can be no head and shoulders pattern. Second, traders
should keep an eye on trading volume. In an ideal head and shoulders pattern,
volume will be highest as the left shoulder forms, lower as the head forms, and
lowest as the right shoulder forms. In addition, the volume should increase as
the left shoulder declines to the first trough and as the head declines to the
second trough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2 - Wait for the Breakdown: The breakdown at the end of a head and
shoulders pattern occurs when the neckline is broken. This breakdown should be
convincing, occurring on strong volume and coinciding with momentum indicators
pointing towards strong bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 3 - Enter a Trade: Once a breakdown is confirmed, traders can enter a
trade. Since a head and shoulders pattern predicts a bearish move, most traders
will short the target stock to profit from the breakdown. The expected size of
the breakdown can be estimated by measuring the distance from the top of the
head to the neckline directly below the head.

Step 4 - Take Profit: To determine the target price in the Head and Shoulders
pattern, the distance between the top of the head and the neckline is calculated
and this distance is added below the neckline. Thus, if the price triggers the
Head and Shoulders, the likely target is found.

Step 5- Stop Loss: It is also important to consider the possibility that the
formation may break down and remain a trap. You can minimize your losses by
placing the stop loss just above the neckline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we confirm the pattern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several
different methods can be used to confirm the formation. One of them is volume
analysis - an increase in volume as the neckline is broken increases the
reliability of the formation. Or we can use technical indicators - indicators
such as the support of moving averages, the candle formation formed on the
neckline, and the rapid completion of the right shoulder can help confirm the
formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
is symmetrical to the head and shoulder formation. It appears at the end of a
downtrend.The first component of an
inverse head and shoulders pattern is a lead-in downtrend, which is a clear
downward trend in the price of the asset. This downtrend is typically
characterized by a series of lower lows and lower highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to trade an inverse Head and
Shoulders Pattern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
first step in trading an inverse head and shoulders pattern is to identify the
pattern. This involves looking for the lead-in downtrend, the inverse head and
shoulders formation, and the potential reversal breakout above the neckline
resistance.  Candlestick patterns are
rarely as uniform as pictures often suggest, but formations should still be
visible to a practiced eye. If you see a low followed by a lower low (the left
shoulder and head), be on the lookout for that higher low (right shoulder) to
potentially catch the break out before it gets away from you. Waiting for the
breakout to confirm the bullish reversal can be the safer trade, but sometimes
entering while the right shoulder is forming offers the best risk-to-reward.
However, traders should always be cautious trading off of still-forming
patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to manage risk management on Head
and Shoulders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most important risk management step is to set the right
stop-loss level. The ideal stop-loss point in the pattern is above the neckline.
If the price goes back above the neckline after the formation is broken, it
means the formation is unsuccessful. In this case, closing your position is the
best approach to prevent further losses.

Setting a target price and taking profit when this target is reached is part of
disciplined risk management. In the formation, the target price is calculated
by measuring the distance between the head and neckline below the neckline
breakout. However, the exact target price may not always be reached. Therefore,
gradually reducing your position as you approach the target or using a trailing
stop can help you protect your profit.

And, it is important to get confirmation with other technical indicators to
increase the reliability of the pattern. By using additional tools such as
volume analysis, momentum indicators or trend indicators, you can increase the
chances of the pattern being successful and better manage your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the Head and Shoulders pattern safe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Head and Shoulders formation is one of the most recognized and
used formations in technical analysis, it does not have absolute reliability,
as with every formation. The reliability of the formation may vary depending on
market conditions, time frame and other factors. The most powerful aspect of
the formation is that it is formed after a long uptrend and clearly signals a
trend change. Especially when supported by high trading volume, the formation&apos;s
chance of success increases. However, not every formation in the market is
successful and in some cases it can produce false signals. One important point
to note is the mistake of entering the trade before the formation is fully
completed. Taking a position before the neckline is definitely broken means
acting prematurely, which usually results in a loss. It is important to be
patient and wait for confirmation signals for the formation to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
Head and Shoulders pattern is one of the most reliable and widely recognized
reversal patterns in technical analysis. It signals a potential change in trend
direction, typically from bullish to bearish in its standard form, and from
bearish to bullish in its inverse variation. It consists of three peaks: a
higher central peak (head) flanked by two lower peaks (shoulders).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline (or above, in the
inverse case) with increased volume. Often used to anticipate reversals and
identify entry and exit points. Used correctly, the Head and Shoulders pattern
helps traders spot major turning points and improve their decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Price Forecast &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, I am watching $117k - $119k on the Bitcoin futures. Now I apologize for the next video not having audio due to a technical issue being looked into, but I am sure most of you with a will, will find a way, and see why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you will note in the chart within the video, also shown below, that we have that little grey line for an expected price level of liquadation at $115,500. I explain what this means further below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Understanding Liquidation Levels and How They Influence Bitcoin Price Forecast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bitcoin traders and investors, understanding liquidation levels—especially those linked to large positions—is crucial. Liquidations can dramatically influence short-term price movements, triggering swift and often volatile market reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;What Does &apos;Liquidation&apos; Actually Mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cryptocurrency futures trading, liquidation occurs when a trader&apos;s leveraged position is closed automatically by the exchange because the position&apos;s margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Traders holding leveraged long positions (expecting price to rise) will face liquidation if the price moves significantly lower. Conversely, leveraged short positions (expecting prices to drop) face liquidation if prices rise significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;What Is &apos;Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage&apos;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;cumulative short liquidation leverage&quot; refers to the total amount of short positions that could be forcibly closed if Bitcoin&apos;s price hits a certain level. When the price approaches these liquidation points, shorts become at risk of being liquidated, forcing these traders to buy Bitcoin at market prices to cover their positions. This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let&apos;s consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a large liquidation occurs (let&apos;s say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it&apos;s common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Track Whales Specifically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant &quot;whale&quot; positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;3:1-3:24&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Price Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;5:1-5:92&quot;&gt;My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;7:1-7:217&quot;&gt;Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

      <title>2025 Rate Cut Countdown: How Low Will the Fed Go?</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/2025-rate-cut-countdown-how-low-will-the-fed-go-20250522/</link>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The latest numbers on American inflation
have left the global financial community wondering. How many times will the
Federal Reserve cut interest rates this year? With inflation at a four-year
low, markets are tracking every hint and putting their probabilities together
with rising confidence. The April 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) figure,
released on May 13 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was a stark departure
from the inflation forecast and had the potential to determine the Fed&apos;s action
plan for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disinflation gathers pace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April headline CPI rose just 0.2%, a
recovery from the 0.1% fall in March. Far more significant, the year-on-year
inflation rate slowed to 2.3%, the lowest since February 2021. The reading
records not just the fading away of pandemic-driven temporary price shocks but
also the growing potency of the Fed&apos;s two-year effort at aggressive monetary
tightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core CPI, stripping out volatile food and
energy prices, also held steady at 2.8% year-over-year. While still above the
Fed&apos;s 2% benchmark, the slowdown is the first sign that the most stubborn
causes of inflation — services, housing, and wage-sensitive sectors — are no
longer accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight April activity is a sharp 12.7%
decline in egg prices and a 0.4% decline in &quot;food at home&quot; as both
capture relief in pantry goods. Shelter costs, which make up more than
one-third of the CPI basket, however, rose 0.3%. This ongoing rise in housing
costs remains frustrating to the Fed as core inflation continues to be sticky
even as headline numbers ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading between the lines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its May 7 session, the Federal Reserve
decided to leave its target rate of 4.25%-4.50% in place, citing
&quot;cross-economic trends&quot; and the still uncertain rate of core
inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made cautious but honest comments at his
press conference, casting aside any reservations when he stated that a rate cut
is within reach, but not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We notice encouraging signs, but
too soon to declare victory,&quot; Powell stated. &quot;We need more confidence
that inflation is on track to a sustainable path to 2%.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed release also mentioned new
geopolitical tensions, decelerating capital expenditures, and the emerging
effects of recent trade measures. Market participants interpret the Fed&apos;s words
as &quot;dovish&quot;, since futures prices signal one or two rate cuts through
2025, and some speculative bets signal three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is not lost on veteran
investors: whereas the Fed assures it uses data, markets increasingly depend on
the Fed. Each drop in the consumer price index, each report on labor markets,
and each trade news headline are now used in figuring out the rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade tensions and tariffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April also saw the introduction of a 10%
across-the-board tariff applied to all US imports, as well as targeted
increases on Chinese consumer electronics, EV batteries, and foreign-made
autos. These protectionist measures, although geared toward reshoring critical
supply chains and energizing domestic production, pose a complex inflationary
risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, these tariffs have not much
impacted consumer prices — perhaps due to long-term contracts, delayed
pass-through effects, or offsetting cuts elsewhere. But experts expect
inflation to return in the summer once businesses begin to raise their prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial progress is the initial
US-China trade agreement in early May to reduce trade tensions. Under this
agreement, both nations agreed to roll back selected tariffs during Q3 2025. If
it succeeds, the agreement will solve some of the tariff-sustained inflation
and soften pressure on the Fed to be higher for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forex markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key rate cut could significantly affect
the market as a whole. Let&apos;s examine a few instruments closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDollar fell to the critical support
area of 61.8 Fibonacci, and rebounded. However, the price is ready to retest
this area again. At the same time, Parabolic SAR indicates the possibility of
growth, and CCI came out of the oversold zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
A break of the 99.000 support area
will drop the price to 95.500;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
A rebound from the support will
bring USDollar back to 101.500 and further to 104.000;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XAUUSD continues to update historical
highs, and the price is consolidating near 261.8 Fibonacci. The price crossed
the upper Bollinger line, indicating overbought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
Consolidation above 3300 will open
the way to 4200;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●     
A rebound from resistance will
drop Gold to 2750 and on further decline to 2500;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is currency traders&apos; top worry whether
the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will follow suit. If the Fed
cuts spending but its counterparts do not, the dollar could fall further. But
if inflation stabilizes and the Fed procrastinates, the dollar&apos;s appreciation
could persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Japanese yen and Swiss
franc, the safe-haven currencies, also increased modestly as expectations of
falling interest rates cause the re-evaluation of risks. Volatility in the
foreign exchange market is expected to increase during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many cuts are coming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the April CPI numbers in hand and
inflation seemingly front and center, everyone is waiting for the Federal
Reserve to act. It&apos;s no longer a question of whether the Fed will cut rates,
but how often. The existing futures markets are already pricing in a 70% chance
of the first cut being in September, followed by a second in December, which is
increasingly likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is uncertainty. Sticky core
inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, the wild card path of tariffs, and a
still-resilient labor market complicate the projection. The Fed&apos;s dual mandate
— maximum employment and price stability — remains a tightrope. If hiring slows
while inflation keeps falling, the Fed could move more aggressively. If
inflation re-accelerates, cuts could be delayed into never-never land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April consumer price index report may
be the most significant reading of the year. He puts the US economy at a fork
in the road: low inflation, steady jobs, and a central bank faced with patience
or preventive measures. The next couple of months will be a test of the Fed&apos;s
mettle, market imagination, and the strength of international trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the currency markets, volatility will
be an opportunity as well as a risk. As the Fed balances down the inflation
rate and the dollar serves as a barometer of the world&apos;s economy, volatility
will make both investors and policy makers prepare for a data-driven,
diplomatically influenced, and decisions-yet-to-be-made second half of 2025&lt;/p&gt;
