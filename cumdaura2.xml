                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;145&quot; data-end=&quot;712&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, as widely expected, but the surprise came in the vote split. The decision passed with a 7-2-0 vote, falling short of the anticipated unanimous 9-0-0. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden pushed for a deeper 50 basis point cut, while Catherine Mann and Huw Pill unexpectedly voted to keep rates unchanged at 4.50%. That unexpected hawkish dissent triggered a kneejerk reaction in sterling, with GBPUSD spiking from around 1.3241 to 1.3344 before fading and rotating back toward session lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;714&quot; data-end=&quot;1047&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the rate cut, the BOE’s guidance remained unchanged, emphasizing a “gradual and careful” approach to easing—repeating the tone from March. As in previous meetings, markets quickly shifted focus from the headline rate move to the vote distribution, which revealed a more divided Monetary Policy Committee than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1049&quot; data-end=&quot;1620&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the intraday reversal has turned the momentum back in favor of sellers. The pair has now retraced toward the day’s low at 1.3241, with a break below that level and the April 23 low at 1.3233 opening the door toward a swing area between 1.32017 and 1.32067. A move below that zone would target the 38.2% retracement of the April rally at 1.31603. With the price back under both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, sellers have short-term control—but they’ll need a break of those downside targets to confirm and extend the bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $59.91, up $1.84 or 3.17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price today reached $57.77. The high reached $60.02.  Technically, the price is closing above the 100/200 hour MAs at $58.30 and $59.15.  Getting and staying above those MAs gives the buyers some hope with the 38.2% of the move down from the April high at $61.63 as the next target. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar stormed ahead today, particularly USD/JPY which is now up 210 pips to 145.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on what&apos;s driving the move:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) A delayed reaction to the Fed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell was hawkish yesterday and the market has priced out about 40 basis points in Fed rate cuts in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The UK trade deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some element of smoke-and-mirrors with the UK trade deal but it&apos;s not devoid of substance. The US has been touting deals and got one here and the market may be anticipating more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The art of the deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&apos;s a preposterous idea to think the US can get away with a 10% tariff floor while asking other countries to bring down trade barriers but maybe I&apos;m wrong. The UK today lowered barriers for imports from the US and accepted -- at least for now -- a 10% tariff. And that&apos;s with the UK having a trade surplus with the USA. Maybe Trump really is a deal-making magician and he will roll more-meaningful US trade partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Trump sounded better on China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is the big one. He said that talks with China would be &apos;substantive&apos; and that tariffs would come down (though in part because &quot;they can&apos;t go any higher&quot;). It&apos;s not much but it&apos;s a change in tone and an indication that he expects progress this weekend. It&apos;s tough to read the tea leaves on this one but the market is sensing progress.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church has elected American Robert Prevost, 69, as its new leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the first American and the first native-English speaker to be named Pope but also speaks Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese and can read Latin and German. He has taken the name Leo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevost headed the Vatican Dicastery for Bishops, which is the office tasked with bishop appointments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are often worried about teaching doctrine, but we risk forgetting 
that our first duty is to communicate the beauty and joy of knowing 
Jesus,&quot; Prevost, in one of his few interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/papal-front-runner-interest-polyglot-us-cardinal-prevost-rises-italian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Vatican News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication said Prevost brings to the table pastoral experience in the peripheries with 
expertise in navigating the complexities of the church&apos;s central 
governance.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury will auction off $25 billion of 30 year bonds at the top of the hour.  The six-month averages of the key components shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tail -0.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bid to Cover 2.45X&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Directs (domestic buyers) 22.3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indirects (international buyers) 63.9%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dealers 13.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last auction had a high yield of 4.813%. The current yield is at 4.816% not far from that level. At the last auction, the tail was -2.6 basis points with Bid to cover at 2.43X. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD has also broke to the downside as focus turns to the EU as a potential whipping dog for Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the prices also making a key break below support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low price going back to April 15 and May 1 at 1.1265 was broken. Before that, the 61.8% retracement of the trading range since the 2020 high at 1.1271 and the swing high from 2023 at 12754 was broken. That area between 1.1265 and 1.1275 is now a risks defining level for sellers looking for more downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer risk level would be the broken 38.2% retracement of the trend move up from the March 27 well. That level comes in at 1.27505. Staying below that level gives the sellers a go-ahead to push lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key target would be the 50% midpoint at 1.11509. If the sellers are to restart their control, getting to that level is a level to aspire toward. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;216&quot; data-end=&quot;426&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDJPY is pushing higher today, supported by rising U.S. yields and a broader move higher in equities. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 6.2 basis points to 4.339%, providing a tailwind for the pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;428&quot; data-end=&quot;894&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a technical perspective, the price has now moved above its 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which comes in at 145.159—a bullish development. The next key upside target is the high from last week at 145.919, a level that previously stalled gains when the pair was testing that same 200-bar MA. Now that the moving average has drifted lower, that resistance stands as a more manageable hurdle—but still a significant one for bulls to clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;896&quot; data-end=&quot;1075&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above 145.919 would strengthen the bullish bias and expose the March low at 146.534, followed by the 38.2% retracement of the January–April decline at 147.138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1077&quot; data-end=&quot;1201&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers are making a play. The question now is whether they can sustain momentum and push beyond the key resistance zone. Close risk is now the broken 200 bar moving average at 145.159.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Risk assets are running today and crypto is flying. Bitcoin is up 4.7% to $101K in the first break above that level since early February. Ethereum is up nearly 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market likes what it heard about Trump&apos;s trade deal with the UK. The President was also upbeat on talks with China and said they will be &apos;substantial&apos; and advised people to buy stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has the market thinking more good news will be coming on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without that, bitcoin has shown some impressive resilience lately and that built the foundation for the recent rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting development today relates back to this tweet from March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweet caused a short-lived rally in those coins but later led to consternation and Trump hastily tweeted something else about including bitcoin and ETH as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/ballard-trump-wiles-lobbyist-00333953&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;writes &lt;/a&gt;that a powerful lobbyist was behind the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;story-text__paragraph  &quot;&gt;On a Sunday morning in early March, President Donald Trump greenlit a Truth Social post promoting a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Hours later, he felt like he’d been played.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;story-text__paragraph  &quot;&gt;That weekend at Mar-a-Lago, an 
employee of the lobby shop run by Brian Ballard who was attending a 
donor event at the resort, had personally buttonholed the president and 
encouraged him multiple times to tout his desire to promote the 
industry. She even gave him a copy of a message she thought he should 
write.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It
 was only after he posted that missive that Trump realized a company 
behind one of the tokens named in the post, Ripple Labs, was a Ballard 
client. He was furious and felt like he’d been used, according to two 
people familiar with the incident who were granted anonymity to speak 
candidly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“He is not welcome in anything 
anymore,” the president told associates at the White House that month, 
the people said, referring to Ballard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s an interesting look at how things get done in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Trump trade deal with the UK is igniting stocks with the major indices all up by over 1.4%. And Trump said &quot;Better go out and buy stocks now&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snapshot of the market currently shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average is trading up 576 points or 1.40% at 41688.78. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index is up 78.23 points or 1.40% at 5709.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index is trading up 317 points or 1.79% at 18053.90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major indices all closed higher yesterday snapping a 2-day decline to start the new trading week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is now up 0.44% for the week while the S&amp;amp;P index is at a similar 0.42%. The Dow industrial average is leading the way with a gain of 0.93%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK deal was somewhat low-hanging fruit. Discussions with China this weekend in Switzerland will be more important as will trade deals with Europe, Canada, Mexico and Japan. China currently has tariffs of 145% which has stopped shipments into the US ports. Jobs at the docks and with truck drivers are at risk.  How low can tariffs go on some progress from the meeting?  Does it make a difference whether it&apos;s 75% or 145%?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said lower imports represented a $1.1 billion benefit to the US so a &quot;slowdown is the good thing&quot;..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, European indices are mostly higher with modest gains in Spain, and declines in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +1.08%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frances CAC, +0.89%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 -0.32%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex +0.06%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +1.71%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX is closing just below the record high at 23420 going back to March 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB is pushing the March 19 hi close at 39712.65&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Well there it is. Trump is talking like 10% is the floor, answering a big question in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Trump often says one thing and does another but that doesn&apos;t bode well for making many deals.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;147&quot; data-end=&quot;527&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is trading back to the downsideas sellers leaned early against key resistance levels (near 100 and 200 hour MA) and instead pushed toward a critical support zone. The price has now returned to a key support area between 1.1265 and 1.12754, a zone that previously acted as a springboard for upside moves. This level is once again being tested, and its ability to hold will be crucial for near-term directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;529&quot; data-end=&quot;778&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair remains below both the 100-hour moving average (currently near 1.1339) and the 200-hour moving average (near 1.1327), reinforcing the bearish tone. Over time, unless EURUSD can break back above those moving averages, sellers remain in control at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;780&quot; data-end=&quot;1079&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below 1.1265 would increase downside pressure and shift the focus toward the next major target at 1.12505, which corresponds to the 38.2% retracement of the 2024 rally. Further declines would expose support near 1.1200 to 1.1213 and 1.11509, where the 50% retracement level resides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1081&quot; data-end=&quot;1268&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For bulls to regain control, the price needs to move back above the 100/200-hour MAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1442&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support Levels:
• 1.1265–1.1275 = Key support zone
• 1.12505 = 38.2% retracement of 2024 move
• 1.1200–1.1213 = Swing area
• 1.11592 = 50% retracement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1444&quot; data-end=&quot;1572&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance Levels:
• 1.1327 = 100-hour MA
• 1.1339 = 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1579&quot; data-end=&quot;1653&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch for price action around 1.1265—this is the battleground for control.&lt;/p&gt;

How much though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, it could be. I mean, we&apos;re going to see. Right now, you can&apos;t get any higher -- it&apos;s at 145% -- so we know it&apos;s coming down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The UK is now offering up its spin on the deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aluminum and steel tariffs reduced to zero&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US deal gives unprecedented access for British farmers to US market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will remove UK tariffs of US ethanol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK has market access on beef with a tariff-free quota of 13,000 metric tonnes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK and US have agreed to work on a digital trade deal that will strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digital services tax remains unchanged as part of the deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will work on remaining sectors such as pharma and remaining reciprocal tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an upbeat take but the FTSE is at the lows of the day and GBP has faded.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is not known for underselling. Here are some of the details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK has committed to fast-tracking US goods imports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreement increases access for beef and ethanol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK will reduce non-tariff barriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final details will be written up in the coming weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think China wants to make a deal very badly too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re going to be &apos;un-easing&apos; steel, want protections for steel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US-UK trade deal will eald to the creation of an aluminum and steel trading zone and a secure pharma supply chain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t much meat on these bones. Trump also turned some of the focus to China and added “I can tell you China very much wants to make a deal.  We’ll see how that works out”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starmer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deal will boost trade and create jobs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says the deal is &apos;a tribute to your leadership&apos; to Trump&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groveling from Starmer was really something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutnick is highlighting that the 10% tariff will remain and that the UK tariffs will raise $6 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK will announce it is going to buy $10 billion in Boeing planes today, won&apos;t name airline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutnick talked about creating a secure supply chain in things like steel and pharma. That could be a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Market Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market presents a mixed picture today, with notable performances in the consumer cyclical and communication services sectors. Giants like Tesla and Google are emerging as the day&apos;s winners, while the healthcare sector faces significant setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📈 Consumer Cyclical &amp; Communication Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla (TSLA) shines: Tesla has surged by 1.97%, showcasing strong investor confidence in the auto manufacturing sector as it continues to push innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon (AMZN) remains robust: With a gain of 0.81%, Amazon reflects positive sentiment in internet retail, possibly buoyed by recent consumer spending trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google (GOOG) leads in communication services: Google gains 1.64%, indicating resilient growth in internet content and information services. This uptick highlights investor optimism following strategic expansions within the sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;🏥 Healthcare Sector Woes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lilly (LLY) declines steeply: Lilly sees a sharp drop of 4.31%, contributing to the healthcare sector&apos;s struggles. This may be due to recent regulatory challenges or negative news affecting drug manufacturers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK): Both experience significant declines, down 1.79% and 1.32% respectively, reflecting broader concerns within pharmaceuticals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;💹 Financial Sector Resurgence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC): Both institutions post gains of over 1.43%, indicating a healthy recovery or investor pivot towards stable banking stocks amidst rising interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall Market Sentiment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market&apos;s mood today appears cautiously optimistic, driven by sector-specific dynamics rather than broad-based rallies. While tech and consumer companies appear to capture investor interest, the healthcare sector&apos;s downturn underscores existing vulnerabilities and market-specific news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investors should leverage the growth in consumer cyclical and tech sectors, considering potential rebounds or strategic announcements. Monitoring major players like Tesla and Google could yield opportunities as they capitalize on emerging trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given healthcare volatility, consider re-balancing exposure to diversify risk or capitalize on potential dips in firms with strong long-term fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay informed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for real-time updates and insights to navigate market dynamics effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, maintaining a diversified portfolio will be key in navigating today&apos;s mixed yet evolving marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bank of Canada highlights risks to the Canadian housing market</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Canada is out with its latest Financial Stability &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/05/financial-stability-report-2025/#Lower-interest-rates-are-easing-the-pressure-on-mortgage-holders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s mostly a risk-highlighting exercise that has little impact on financial markets but I do want to highlight one part of the report because I believe that housing market risks are mounting and prices are falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Among households with a mortgage, 60% are facing renewal this year or in
2026. Most of those renewing will see their payments rise because they took out
their mortgage during the pandemic when rates were very low. But the average
increase will be smaller than what we expected a year ago.
Still, if a large economic shock causes job losses, it will be harder for some
households to keep up with their debt payments.
A prolonged trade war may be that shock. It would cause demand for Canadian
exports to fall and disrupt supply chains, threatening jobs and incomes. Workers
in trade-dependent industries could find it particularly difficult to continue
managing their debt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers were released from the Toronto Real Estate Board yesterday and show sales down 23% y/y with listings up 54% y/y. The condo market is particularly dire but detached homes are cracking as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Space and Time Launches on Mainnet to Power a New Generation of Data-Driven Crypto Apps</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Space and Time, the
Microsoft-backed blockchain for zero-knowledge (ZK)-proven data, is live on its
public, permissionless mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time is designed to deliver ZK-proven data to
smart contracts to power a new generation of data-driven crypto applications.
It indexes data from other major blockchains, including Ethereum, and stores it
across a decentralized network of database validators. Developers can access,
query ZK-prove and connect this data back to their smart contract using Proof
of SQL, Space and Time’s sub-second ZK coprocessor for SQL database queries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prior to Space and Time, onchain applications had no way
to query basic user data from a database of blockchain activity without
introducing security risks and tampering. In addition, enterprises had no way
to securely connect their cloud databases with smart contracts. Today we’re
thrilled to announce the mainnet launch of Space and Time, which will empower
developers to build sophisticated, data-driven onchain applications secured by
cryptographic proofs,” said Scott Dykstra, Contributor #001 at Space and
Time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts today can’t natively access historical,
cross-chain or offchain data, which limits the complexity of onchain apps.
Chainlink pioneered external data access for smart contracts with secure
oracles and cross-chain messaging, solving key pieces of the context problem.
The next wave of onchain innovation—spanning everything from dynamic financial
instruments to data-rich AI agents and tokenized real-world systems—will
require a trustless database layer for complex data retrieval. Space and Time enables
this with a verifiable, decentralized database network that gives smart
contracts the ability to query the full history of Ethereum and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smart contracts need context to make decisions, whether
it’s real-time market data, cross-chain messaging or historical onchain
activity. Chainlink provides the connective tissue for data to move securely
across systems, and Space and Time brings powerful new compute capabilities
that complement that vision. Together, we’re pushing the boundaries of what
developers can build onchain,” said Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time was created by MakeInfinite Labs, a frontier
protocol research lab that is backed by Microsoft and working alongside major
financial institutions. In addition to its work on Space and Time, the firm has
developed key technologies to the broader crypto ecosystem, such as Proof of
SQL, Blitzar, an Elastic Network ZK Chain for Space and Time, and Chainlink
DeFi Yield Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MakeInfinite Labs, we’re focused on building
foundational infrastructure to enable the next generation of crypto
applications. Contributing core technologies like Proof of SQL and the original
architecture of Space and Time is part of that vision. We’re excited to see the
ecosystem take this work forward and unlock new possibilities for verifiable,
data-driven applications,” said Nate Holiday, CEO of MakeInfinite Labs &amp;amp;
Co-Founder of Space and Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time is secured by a decentralized set of
validators, and anyone can contribute to the network by providing high-quality
datasets, staking or running a validator node. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Space and Time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space and Time (https://www.spaceandtime.io) is the
blockchain for ZK-proven data, which enables smart contracts to trustlessly
access and compute over data from any chain or source. Powered by Proof of SQL,
a sub-second ZK coprocessor, Space and Time empowers developers to build more
intelligent, data-rich applications with verifiable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About MakeInfinite Labs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakeInfinite Labs is a frontier protocol research lab
contributing to some of the most prominent protocols and ecosystems across
crypto, including the creation of Space and Time. MakeInfinite Labs raised $50
million from Microsoft’s M12 Ventures and other leading investors to build the
infrastructure that enables developers and creators to build data-driven
applications, tokenize and monetize and win in the AI economy.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Report from the Telegraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will be part of a 12-month temporary deal ahead of what sides hope is a comprehensive deal &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will cut beef tariffs close to zero&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff on UK steel exports will also be lowered, but rate not finalized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is running late but it looks like these are the important parts. It&apos;s not much of a deal but it does leave room to negotiate away the 10% in a comprehensive deal. You&apos;d have to think the UK thinks they can get there or they wouldn&apos;t be taking down barriers but we&apos;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;176&quot; data-end=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD  moved lower yesterday and moved back below the 200 day MA (currently at 0.64608) and the rising 100 hour MA (blue line currently at the same 0.64608 level).  The fall stalled near the 200 hour MA into the close and rebounced in the early Asian Pacific session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;176&quot; data-end=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price move higher earlier in the day stalled near a dual resistance zone, defined by the 100-hour moving average and the 200-day moving average, both converging near 0.64608. That rejection marked a turning point, as the price quickly rotated lower, breaking below the 200-hour moving average at 0.6430—a short-term bearish shift. The price also reentered into a Red Box consolidation area that defined the trading range going back to mid-April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;557&quot; data-end=&quot;875&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Selling momentum carried the pair down toward the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, located at 0.6408, where support buyers stepped in, temporarily halting the decline. The bounce that followed has brought the price back toward the 200-hour MA, now acting as the close resistance level. The high of the Red Box extends up to 0.64419.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;877&quot; data-end=&quot;1213&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sellers are making a play back below the 200 day moving average, the 100 hour moving average, and back within the Red Box and the 200 hour moving average. The buying break to the upside earlier this week is fizzling out a bit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;877&quot; data-end=&quot;1213&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Going forward, if price breaks and stays below 0.6408, it would open the door for a deeper correction toward the next lower swing area and the 200-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, currently near 0.6318.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1220&quot; data-end=&quot;1245&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1334&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1334&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:
• 0.64608 = 100-hour MA / 200-day MA
• 0.6430 = 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1336&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1469&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:
• 0.6408 = 100-bar MA on 4-hour chart
• 0.63437 = lower swing area
• 0.6318 = 200-bar MA on 4-hour chart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1476&quot; data-end=&quot;1609&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers will look for a sustained break below 0.6408 to add confidence, while buyers need a move back above 0.6460 to regain control.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The source here is &apos;Wall Street Execs&apos; so take it with a grain of salt but this isn&apos;t a good sign:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BREAKING: Wall Street execs with contracts in the White House say the plan for trade deals on tap — India, Japan, South Korea and Australia— is to have tariffs at or around 10 per like UK. China, of course, is another story. Developing&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t seem many countries offering up concessions for the privilege of exporting with 10% tariffs. If anything, others are likely to retaliate. This helps to explain why progress with Japan quickly fell apart and why Trump is now looking to dictate trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not a good sign but it&apos;s also not clear if Congress will tolerate it for the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something we sniffed out at the beginning: That the high &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariffs were some kind of opening-bid smokescreen to get countries to accept 10%. We&apos;ll have to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
