                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a nice day for DAX traders as political volatility provided some nice opportunities. Below you can see the 5 minute chart of the DAX where I marked the two main headlines that triggered the biggest moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a great example for new traders on being open minded and nimble when conditions change. The fear of political instability triggered by the failure of the first voting round sent the DAX lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we started to get more and more news of support for a second round as soon as tomorrow, the fears started to ease and the dip-buyers started to pile in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s critical for a trader to be open minded and not get attached to his/her own bias when conditions change. If you took a trade because of X and something invalidates the original reason, just get out. This will not save you money in the long term, but might also improve your performance if you can also take the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We feel the market has returned to a more stable situation today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expectations of the Taiwanese dollar appreciating have mostly gone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/TWD has been more well behaved today after all the warnings since yesterday. But when you have officials put in place and scrutinising every move, that sort of helps I guess. This calls for a bit of storytelling time..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;When central banks act this way, it&apos;s usually a case of damage control and trying to cook something up to appease the media/public. I&apos;m not saying that is what is happening with Taiwan but there are cases around the world where these things do happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In my own experience, it was all the way back in 2016 when Trump pulled off a surprise to win the US election at the time. The dollar surged strongly against emerging market currencies and things really took off. I was on the trading floor and things turned quite chaotic in just a span of two to three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In just three sessions, we already saw the local currency depreciate by over 7% by the end of day close. And when we got to office early the next morning, the offshore market i.e. non-deliverable forwards were indicating a gap open with the currency set to fall by another 13% overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;An hour before the market opens, the central bank calls us and all the other banks up and tells us that we aren&apos;t allowed to quote or do any trades until further notice. We&apos;re also not allowed to perform any deals for/with clients. And they said they will be sending an officer to each bank as they think of a way to manage the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For a good six hours, we had zero trades in the local market and zero transactions with clients. All incoming calls were just deflected by a case of &quot;system issue&quot;. Clients were of course mad but they sort of understood - at least the bigger corporates - when every single bank was refusing to offer a quote, even an indicative one. We weren&apos;t even allowed to say anything about where the offshore market was trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If any trader or dealer made a quote in the market or to their clients, he/she was fired on the spot and placed &quot;under investigation&quot;. Not a joke by the way. It didn&apos;t happen with my bank but it did happen to a friend of a friend unfortunately. And he never came back to work on the trading floor after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I remember that lunch time, I stepped out and called my parents to just change whatever you can out of the local currency. It felt like that moment in the movie The Big Short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So after six hours, we were told to quote everything at the previous day closing price. Mind you, this was some 15-20% away what the offshore market was still trading. We settled our transactions and come end of day, we were told that whatever positions we have at the end of the day will be squared directly with the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, the offshore market i.e. NDFs would not be recognised anymore and starting from the next day, all incoming foreign funds into the country will be forcefully converted into the local currency at a 75% notional amount minimum. This continued for quite a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had clients with existing forward contracts and long-term FX contracts that had to be unwound because of these forced conversions. The central bank did not entertain any appeals for that and those clients lost millions on swaps. But in the end, it was a case of trying to control the narrative and put up a facade that the &quot;market&quot; was still working. On paper, it sort of looked like it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But even after nine years now, I always believe that the damage has already been done. If not through one way, then at least surely another. At one point, the local currency was even threatened to be kicked out of the MSCI basket. There was a lame workaround to circumvent that in the end though, something to do with extending trading hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But every time I look at the screen, all I can think of is this story. And when I look at the exchange rate itself, I know deep down that it doesn&apos;t fully reflect how fundamentally flawed the currency really is. If this were a free-floating exchange rate system, things would&apos;ve looked so, so much different. But alas, it was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So yeah, that&apos;s my story for today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Should You Look for in a Reliable, Secure Offshore Account?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Offshore Account Security: Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is transparency important in offshore accounts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency is essential because it allows traders to fully
understand where their account is regulated, how their funds are handled, and
what protections are in place. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot;&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;,
we clearly inform clients about the regulatory jurisdiction of each account,
whether it is FCA-cleared or offshore-regulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This openness empowers traders to make informed decisions
and avoid the risks associated with unregulated or opaque platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What regulatory credentials should you look for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evaluating an offshore account, always look for
platforms regulated by top-tier authorities. EBC holds licences from the FCA
(UK), ASIC (Australia), and CIMA (Cayman Islands). These regulators enforce
strict standards for fund segregation, client protection, and operational
transparency. Choosing a platform with multiple reputable licenses ensure your
trading environment is secure and your interests are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are client funds protected at EBC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC safeguards client funds by holding them in segregated
accounts with trusted custodians such as Barclays UK. This means your money is
kept separate from the platform’s operating funds, so even if EBC faces
financial difficulties, your capital remains protected. We never mix client and
operational funds, ensuring the highest level of fund security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What risk management features matter most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective risk management is crucial, especially with the
higher leverage available in offshore accounts. EBC provides a comprehensive
suite of tools, including stop-loss orders, negative balance protection, margin
alerts, and flexible leverage settings. These features help you control your
exposure, prevent excessive losses, and adapt your strategy to changing market
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What trading tools and user experience does EBC offer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBC’s platform is designed for both novice and experienced
traders, offering advanced charting, fast execution, and robust analytical
tools. Our user-friendly interface and technology ensure you can manage trades
efficiently and take advantage of global opportunities, all while maintaining
strong risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always Secure and Transparent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing an offshore account, prioritise
transparency, strong regulation, secure fund management, and effective risk
controls. At EBC, these principles are at the core of our platform, giving you
the confidence to trade globally and securely.&lt;/p&gt;

If you strip that out, producer prices were actually up 0.1% on the month. There were increases in prices for capital goods (+0.1%), durable consumer goods (+0.2%), and non-durable consumer goods (+0.5%).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The problem with a secret ballot is that it is as the name implies, a secret. That means as things stand, Merz wouldn&apos;t even know who he has to talk to in order to turn the votes around unless those who opposed owns up to it. And let&apos;s face it, that never happens in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If they just go in blindly and he loses again, it would be extremely damaging to his and the coalition&apos;s position and credibility. The risk outweighs the reward in this case. As such, it would be prudent to hold it off for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As a reminder, a second vote can be called within the next 14 days now but the same ruling applies i.e. an absolute majority of 316 votes is needed to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If the second round of voting fails again, then a third round of voting must take place immediately. For that, only a relative majority i.e. candidate with the most votes, is needed to be elected as chancellor. But in this case, the president has the authority to not appoint said person to be chancellor and dissolve the Bundestag instead as an option.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final Services PMI 49.0 vs 48.9 preliminary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 52.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final Composite PMI 48.5 vs 48.2 preliminary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 51.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Renewed downturn in new work weighs on service
sector output
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fastest decline in export sales since February 2021
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business activity expectations slump to a two-and-
a-half year low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;UK service sector output slipped into contraction for
the first time in one-and-a-half years as heightened
business uncertainty weighed on order books during
April. Export conditions were particularly weak, with new
business from abroad falling to the greatest extent since
February 2021.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Survey respondents often commented on the impact
of global financial market turbulence in the wake of US
tariff announcements. Businesses in the technology and
financial service sectors noted rising risk aversion and
delayed spending decisions among clients, especially in
relation to major investment plans. Consumer service
providers meanwhile cited subdued domestic economic
conditions and challenges with passing on rising payroll
costs, especially those in the hospitality and leisure
sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Input prices increased at the steepest pace since the
summer of 2023 as higher National Living Wage rates and
National Insurance contributions added to payroll costs
in April. Prices charged inflation was also the strongest
for nearly two years as service providers sought to pass
on additional costs to clients despite fragile demand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Business expectations for the year ahead fell sharply
as service sector firms braced for an extended period of
global economic turbulence and heightened recession
risks. Some 22% of the survey panel predict an outright
decline in business activity during the next 12 months, up
from 14% in March and well above the post-election low
of 6% in July 2024.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It was supposed to be a straightforward appointment for Friedrich Merz to be German chancellor today. But when push comes to shove, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/merz-falls-short-of-majority-needed-to-become-german-chancellor-in-first-voting-round-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;it turned out to be anything but that&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s a big and embarrassing setback for Merz and his coalition, who by the way commands 328 votes in the Bundestag, yet he only managed to secure 310 votes today. He needed 316 votes to secure a majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;re now in a bit of an unprecedented situation in German politics. No candidate for chancellor has ever failed in the first round of voting. However, the constitution does allow up to 14 days for a new round of voting. But will we see another vote today? Or tomorrow? Nobody knows for sure. But the worry here is that the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition may already be damaged before it even begins governing.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, that didn&apos;t go according to plan. The expectation was that Merz would&apos;ve been elected upon the first round of voting and then the Bundestag session will be adjourned as he travels to meet with the German president to formalise his appointment. Now, all of that is put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;He needed 316 votes to win a majority but didn&apos;t manage to reach that (only got 310 votes) even though the CDU/CSU/SPD coalition has 328 MPs. There can be a second or third round of voting but it&apos;s still unclear if that will take place today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Update: The session is now adjourned as the political parties regroup to try and seek a resolution on this.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 51.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 50.4 vs 50.1 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 50.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The reading reaffirms stagnation in the euro area economy to start Q2, with the services sector experiencing a stall. Demand conditions continue to suffer and that&apos;s not a good look amid a more challenging economic backdrop in the months ahead. The good news at least is that price pressures have eased a touch further on the month. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Eurozone economic growth slowed at the start of the second quarter, following a pick-up in the first three months of the
year. The services sector, which is a major player, practically stagnated in April. Even though manufacturing output saw a
surprising uptick, it wasn&apos;t enough to prevent the overall slowdown in growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;In the services sector, cost pressures are still relatively high, though they have eased a bit over the past couple of months.
Inflation is down for sales prices and continued to trend lower. Many members of the European Central Bank (ECB) have
been hinting at another interest rate cut in June, and these latest figures seem to support their stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Euro area employment has seen a slight stabilization. The drop in headcounts among manufacturers has been more-thancounterbalanced by an increase in jobs within the service sector. Overall, there&apos;s still a noticeable hesitation to hire new staff,
which isn&apos;t too surprising given the current uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Spain is leading the pack in terms of growth, followed by Italy, then Germany with marginal growth, and France trailing
behind. This is reflected in the Composite PMI data for the first four months of 2025 and aligns with Eurostat&apos;s GDP data for
the first quarter. We expect Germany to soon outpace Italy thanks to a generous fiscal package, while France is likely to
remain at the bottom for now due to its uncertain political climate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany Composite PMI Output Index at 4-month low.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimism towards year-ahead outlook wanes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The German service sector has hit the brakes. Business activity dipped a bit in April, ending a four-month streak of growth.
The composite PMI didn&apos;t slip into recession territory, thanks to manufacturing companies ramping up production, just like
they did in March after a slump that lasted nearly two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Service providers probably felt the squeeze on profit margins in April. Costs went up more than last month, but they had to
dial back on price hikes. With this in mind, confidence about future business took a hit, with the index dropping further below
its long-term average.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At first glance, the future doesn&apos;t look too bright. New business has shrunk for the eighth month in a row, order book
backlogs have been sliding downhill for most of the past two years, and there&apos;s no sign of a solid recovery in exports. But,
companies are still hiring, and job growth has even picked up for the second month straight. Clearly, businesses aren&apos;t ready
to throw in the towel just yet. And for good reason, as the new government, expected to start this week, could well give the
economy a boost with its fiscal stimulus program in infrastructure and defence, plus more social spending. All of this should
also spread to the services sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 47.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 47.8 vs 47.3 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 48.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The slight revision higher doesn&apos;t take away from the fact that French business activity has now contracted for eight straight months. Demand conditions remain subdued and that&apos;s troubling amid a more challenging outlook in the months ahead. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;April marked another month of declining activity in the French private sector. The HCOB Composite PMI signals a
continued downturn in economic activity in France, driven by weakness in the services sector. However, the manufacturing
sector has managed to increase production for the first time in nearly three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;The French services sector remains on a downward trajectory. Business activity declined again in April, attributed to lower
customer demand and generally poorer market conditions. The rapid decline in new orders is particularly concerning this
month. Surveyed companies report that weak market conditions make it very difficult to attract new business, and existing
customers are also hesitant to engage in new transactions. High trade policy uncertainty seems to be causing
postponements to investment and consumption decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Current developments – weak demand amid high uncertainty – do not bode well for the profit margins of French service
providers. Additionally, our survey results indicate that operating costs, appear to be rising faster than end prices, which
have virtually stagnated due to competitive pressures.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Future business expectations remain in the growth zone, but significantly below the historical average. Employees find
themselves in a concerning situation, as they are increasingly at risk of job loss as workloads decrease due to the order
slump and simultaneous reduction of backlogs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services PMI 52.9 vs. 51.5 expected &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 52.0 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 52.1 vs. 50.5 prior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Output and new orders up at sharper rates in April
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost pressures at their lowest in 2025 so far
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business confidence drops to weakest level in four-and-a-half years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The growth trend appears to be consolidating. The Italian private sector has grown for three months in a row, led by the
service sector, while manufacturing output has practically stopped shrinking after a year. According to the Bank of Italy,
tourism and hospitality have supported growth in the service sector during the first months of the year, which suggests a
certain degree of sustainability. In the manufacturing sector, the question remains as to whether this sector could soon be hit
harder by US tariffs and EU countermeasures. For the year as a whole, we expect economic growth of around half a
percent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The service sector is showing relatively robust growth, which has accelerated slightly compared with the previous month.
Accordingly, service providers have once again hired more people, especially as they were also able to expand new
business more strongly than in March. It’s encouraging that most people were hired on a permanent basis, as panellists
said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tariff uncertainty could also indirectly weigh on the service sector, with the challenging economic and geopolitical
climate mentioned by panellists as having weighed on expectations regarding future activity, with the index already well
below its long-term average. However, especially in these times, the service sector is likely to maintain its role as a stabiliser
of the Italian economy, which it has held for around two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is some slight relief on the cost side for service companies. Operating costs have not risen quite as sharply as in
previous months. However, companies were also unable to increase sales prices at the same pace as before and had to
settle for significantly lower increases, meaning that profit margins were unlikely to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proposed 0 for 0 tariffs on industrial goods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accelerating trade talks with India among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another €170B US-exports may be impacted by tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ready to use all available tools in trade defence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s nothing new here as we&apos;ve been aware of the 0 for 0 offer for weeks. The problem is that we still haven&apos;t got any breakthrough. Last week, French Finance Minister Lombard said that he discussed the idea of reciprocal 
zero tariffs with Scott Bessent, and Bessent told him that it was not 
unrealistic. So, this will keep the hopes alive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Technical Analysis – Focus on the FOMC decision</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/gold-technical-analysis-focus-on-the-fomc-decision-20250506/</link>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold erased last week’s losses
in just a couple of days. It’s unclear what was the catalyst though. I can cite
the usual “dollar weakness, safe haven demand” reasons but those don’t help
with market timing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most plausible explanation
could be the recent volatility in some Asian currencies which would explain the
timing and the safe haven demand. Authorities are now intervening so we could
see an ease in the safe haven demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also the FOMC
decision tomorrow and that could be a risk for the bulls as the Fed is likely
to push back against the aggressively dovish market pricing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture, gold
remains in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid Fed
easing. But in the short-term more positive news on the tariffs front and a
hawkish Fed could trigger more downside for gold as the market readjusts to new
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that gold bounced around the 3200 level and pulled all the way back to the key
swing level at 3370. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a
better risk to reward setup around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt;,
while the sellers will look for a break lower to increase the bearish bets into
the 2957 level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see the price recently broke below the 3258 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;
but eventually climbed back above it and extended the rally into the key swing point
around the 3370 level. This is where we can expect the sellers to step in with
a defined risk above the high to position for a drop into the major trendline.
The buyers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking into a new
high to increase the bullish bets into a new all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor upward trendline defining the bullish momentum. The
buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new
highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to target a drop back into
the 3258 level. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we have the Trump-Carney meeting. Tomorrow, we have
the FOMC Rate Decision, while on Thursday, we get the latest US Jobless Claims
figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 54.7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite PMI 52.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 54.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s a slightly softer reading than estimated, with softer gains in new work recorded on the month. Meanwhile, confidence in the outlook has also fallen to its lowest since November. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“In April, business activity growth in Spain&apos;s private sector slightly slowed according to the HCOB Composite PMI. While
growth in the services sector weakened, production in the manufacturing sector declined. This trend is also reflected in the
order situation: service providers recorded slower order growth, while orders in the manufacturing sector decreased.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“Service providers report a more challenging work environment. This is not surprising, given the increasing tensions in
international markets – keywords: trade frictions – which led to postponed or cancelled consumption and investment
decisions. Despite the slight slowdown, business activity and order levels remain in the growth zone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“Operating costs for Spanish service providers remain high, despite the current slight slowdown. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that trade tariffs have already had initial impacts on supply chains, leading to input price increases. Additionally,
wage increases continue to be a significant driver of prices. As a result of rising input costs, companies are passing these
costs on to their customers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“Spanish service providers remain optimistic about the future, even though the corresponding index recorded a decline this
month, falling to the lowest level of the year. This is mainly due to the uncertainty arising from US tariffs and their effects on
the international trade network. However, this has no immediate impact on Spanish workers. Given the continued growth in
orders and increasing backlogs, service providers added to their workforces.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The Chinese foreign ministry is out saying that they would welcome a visit to China from António Costa and/or Ursula von der Leyen &quot;in a timely manner to hold a new round of China-EU leaders&apos; meeting&quot;. As things stand, both sides are finding some common ground in pushing back against the US and Trump&apos;s tariffs. China has also confirmed that they have lifted all restrictions on mutual exchanges with the EU for now as both sides look to find some solution to the trade war.&lt;/p&gt;

S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.3% after the overnight drop but again as a reminder, it came after nine straight days of gains. We&apos;re pretty much taking a breather until the next meaningful headline hits on tariffs/trade. But the longer that drags on, the more apprehension there will be filling up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today we don&apos;t have much on the agenda other than a few low tier data releases. In the European session, we get the final PMI readings for the UK and Eurozone economy, while in the American session we don&apos;t have anything excepts the 10 year auction for those following it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main event will be the Trump-Carney meeting at 11:45 ET/15:45 GMT where the focus will of course be on tariff related headlines. Also, watch out for trade deals as that&apos;s what the market is eagerly waiting to see. US officials repeated once again that the first one could be announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;
