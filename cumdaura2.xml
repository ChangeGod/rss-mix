                            &lt;p&gt;Trade representatives of APEC member economies are meeting today and tomorrow. To discuss multilateral trade and other cooperation agendas, including reforms of the World Trade Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines via Reuters: APEC sees regional GDP growth for 2025 at 2.6% down from 3.3% earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees export growth for 2025 at 0.4% versus 5.7% in 2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees unprecedented rise in trade policy uncertainty fueled by frictions amplifies risks to growth for trade-dependent economies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees trade policy volatility in April is 9 times greater than average of 2015–2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Export outlook downgrade due largely to US tariffs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APEC stands for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
It is a regional economic forum established in 1989 to promote free trade and economic cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;APEC has 21 member economies, including the United States, China, Japan, Australia, and most major economies bordering the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Australian April 2025 jobs data is here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-april-2025-unemployment-rate-41-vs-41-expected-employment-change-890k-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Australia April 2025 unemployment rate 4.1% (vs. 4.1% expected) &amp;amp; Employment Change +89.0K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;89,000 jobs were added, thebiggest monthly increase in 14 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;59,500 of those full-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a strong, strong result. The consensus analyst expectation was for 20,000 jobs to be added, so the result was more than 4 times that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking some shine off the result is the unemployment rate steady at 4.1%, so no inroads into the jobless rate. Still 4.1% is not too far off 5 decade lows. The participation rate rose to a record high 67.1%. More entrants into the l;about market has held the jobless rate steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said in the data post, this report ushers in the prospect of no rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. the Bank meets on May 19 and 20 and expectations have been wide for a 25bp rate cut. Those expectations will wobble a little on this report. Add in a calming in markets after the US-China ceasefire in Trump&apos;s trade tariff war and its not difficult seeing the RBA holding steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this stage I&apos;m still in the 25bp rate cut camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar popped a few points higher on the report, but so far with no follow-through. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Wow! Big jobs added number, &amp;gt;4* expected! The bulk of that full-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to fuel speculation of no Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut next week. Expectations were widely held of a 25bp cut on May 20. Mix in a calming of Trump&apos;s trade wars and its not too much of a stretch to see the Reserve Bank of Australia on hold next week. The meeting is live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment Change +89.0K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected +20K, prior +32.2K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-Time Employment +59.5K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prior +15K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part-Time Employment +29.5K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prior +17.2K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment Rate 4.1%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected 4.1%, prior 4.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participation Rate 67.1%, a record high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected 66.8%, prior 66.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Chinese financial media reports, again, that there is room for cuts to the RRR  this year</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;In a China Securities Journal article analysts say they see space for further cuts to China&apos;s Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) this year. By 100 to 200 bp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China last cut the RRR on May 7. A 50bp cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d suggest it&apos;ll be many months before we see another cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) is a central bank regulation that sets the minimum amount of reserves each bank must hold in relation to their deposit liabilities. Its the percentage of total deposits that banks are legally required to keep on hand, either as cash in their vaults or in a reserve account at the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In China, this ratio is set by the People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By adjusting the RRR, the PBOC can influence the lending capacity of commercial banks. For example, an increase in RRR means that banks have less money to lend out because they have to keep more in reserve. This reduces the money supply in the economy. Conversely, if the PBOC decreases the reserve ratio, banks have more money to lend because they are required to keep less in reserve. This increases the money supply in the economy, which can stimulate economic activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any guidance on policy would be speculative and wrong, given uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/feds-daly-business-is-cautious-amidst-the-economic-uncertainty-but-not-stalling-out-20250514/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Fed&apos;s Daly: Business is cautious amidst the economic uncertainty, but not &quot;stalling out&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t even know where to start with that comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK ... here goes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not expressing an opinion on what I think the Federal Reserve should do right now. Cut or not cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, given the level of uncertainty Daly is expressing here, what should a central bank do? here goes ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. There is always uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Right now its much higher than usual. Much higher, although since the tariff ceasefire between the US and China is dialled back a little. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. If it&apos;s a time of extreme uncertainty, its not just the central bank that&apos;d be feeling uncertain, but main street business and households probably even more so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. If uncertainty is so high as to lead to paralysis in giving forward guidance then I reckon the correct response is a rate cut. Or, if not that, then dovish talk, to ease concerns, at the margin. Ease financial conditions to give main street more room to move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

Capital Advisors in 1992, which became one of the most successful hedge funds of its time. Following a high-profile insider trading case that led to a $1.8 billion settlement and a two-year ban from managing outside capital, Cohen rebranded his firm as Point72 in 2014. The firm reopened to external investors in 2018 and now manages over $35 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sohn Investment Conference is an annual event held in New York city that brings together leading hedge fund managers and investors to share their market insights and investment ideas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;established in 1995&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; it raises funds for pediatric cancer research through the Sohn Conference Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

From a note on Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Looking forward, short-term, we expect the S&amp;amp;P 500’s recent outperformance to persist as US companies are the bigger beneficiary of the tariff cuts” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;544&quot; data-end=&quot;855&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, analysts st DB tempered expectations for a sustained rally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Although lower than feared for now, in our view, tariffs will still be a bigger burden for US companies than for European companies,” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;broader underperformance could persist “until a substantial cut in tariffs would bring relief”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 update ...

Canada building permits fell -4.1%, erasing most of the 4.5% gain from last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than that, there were the aftermath of the deals made yesterday in the Middle East from Pres. Trump (and staff) with the tech/chip sector reaping most of the rewards.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AMD closed up 4.68% and is up 19.37% since May 6. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA rose 4.16%. Shares are up 34% since April 22&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super Micro Computers (SMCI) surged nearly 15.69% after announcing a multi-year, $20 billion partnership with DataVolt, a Saudi Arabian data center developer.  Shares are up 40.64% since May 9th but is still down some 73% from the 2024 high closing level. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some Fed commentary today with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson stating that the current &quot;moderately restrictive&quot; policy rate is well-positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions. He emphasized that the Fed is closely monitoring hard data for signs of slowing activity, though recent inflation figures suggest continued progress toward the 2% target. However, he warned that the path forward remains uncertain, particularly due to the potential inflationary impact of new tariffs. While the labor market remains solid, Jefferson noted that Q1 GDP figures likely overstated the slowdown in economic activity. He added that whether tariffs cause lasting inflation will depend on their implementation and how supply chains adjust. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Fed&apos;s Goolsbee also spoke to the idea of patience saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He is emphasizing that some of the April inflation data likely reflects the lagged nature of how price trends appear in official statistics. He noted that the Fed remains in a wait-and-see mode, choosing to hold off on any policy shifts until clearer information emerges. Goolsbee cautioned against drawing conclusions about long-term inflation trends amid the current short-term volatility, stressing the importance of filtering out noise in the data. He reiterated that the Fed’s role is to act as a steady hand, not reacting to daily movements in markets or political headlines. His comments reinforce the Fed’s patient stance as it continues to assess evolving economic conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;113&quot; data-end=&quot;630&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, speaking to CNBC from the Sohn Conference, voiced serious concerns about the lack of any meaningful effort to address the U.S. fiscal deficit. He noted that &quot;there isn&apos;t even the beginning of a plan&quot; to confront the issue unless it escalates into a full-blown crisis. He also dismissed recent claims of finding $2 trillion in savings, suggesting the actual figure is closer to $150 billion, with tariffs potentially contributing an additional $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;632&quot; data-end=&quot;1078&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Einhorn expressed skepticism about the focus on the trade deficit, saying he doesn’t view it as a major problem. On gold, he stated he would be pleased to see it rise to $3,500 or $3,800, but not to $30,000, which he implied would reflect severe economic distress. He criticized the current administration for “building a retreat” and argued that the U.S. is not being perceived as a reliable negotiating partner by other nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking ahead, Einhorn believes that the current market fixation on tariffs will likely fade, and other economic themes will take center stage. He also revealed a tactical position: he’s short leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs while holding a long position in MSTR stock. He explained that these leveraged ETFs are costly to operate, as they cannot use swaps and must instead rely on purchasing expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the forex, the USD is ending mostly higher vs the major currencies with the exception vs the JPY (the USD was lower vs the JPY)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EUR +0.15%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JPY -0.45% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GBP +0.38%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHF, +0.39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAD +0.30%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AUD +0.63%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NZD +0.69%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD did try to move lower into European morning session but reversed higher in the US session today.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;107&quot; data-end=&quot;517&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;EURUSD: The pair tested its 200-hour moving average at 1.1261 during the European morning session but failed to hold above it, rotating lower and breaking below the 100-hour moving average at 1.1183. As the session comes to a close, EURUSD is trading near 1.1169. Holding below the 100-hour MA in the new trading day would keep the bearish bias intact and sellers firmly in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;519&quot; data-end=&quot;1011&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;GBPUSD: GBPUSD climbed to test the lower boundary of a key swing area between 1.3362 and 1.33784, but sellers leaned against the level and pushed the price back down toward the 200-hour moving average at 1.32852. While there was modest buying at that level, the support ultimately gave way. The pair is now testing the 100-hour moving average at 1.32556 into the day’s close. A sustained break below that level would further shift momentum in favor of the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY: The USDJPY was down over 1% earlier in the day but rebounded in the US session and is closing here in the rising 100 hour moving average at 146.777. That MA will be a short term barometer into the new trading day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NZDUSD: THe NZDUSD traded above its 100 bar moving average on the four hour chart at 0.59449, but could not sustain momentum. The subsequent fall to the price below the 200 hour moving average at 0.59368 and then the 100 hour moving average of 0.59049. The key 200 day moving average at 0.58828 is the next key target going into the new trading day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the closing levels in the US equities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average fell -89.37 points or -0.21% at 42051.06.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index closed higher on the year for the second consecutive day. Today the price rose modest 6.03 points or 0.10% at 5892.58. The index is up 0.19% for the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index rose 136.72 points or 0.72% at 19146.81.  For the year, the index is down -0.85%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are ending the day higher: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 4.057%, +4.0 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.170%, +4.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.542%, +4.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.975%, +3.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;in other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading down $0.76 at $62.91&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading down $68 or -2.10% at $3181.30. Gold is down 7.8% from its most recent swing high on May 6 as flight to safety flows ease with hopes for more tariff deals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $646 at $103,494.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;91&quot; data-end=&quot;503&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the Trump tariff war has entered a tentative ceasefire, China is not stepping back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;91&quot; data-end=&quot;503&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;China has announced a sweeping effort to enforce tighter export controls on strategic minerals, reinforcing national security through what officials describe as “full-chain management.” The Ministry of Commerce confirmed that the crackdown will span every stage of the supply chain—from mining and smelting to processing, transportation, manufacturing, and export—with an emphasis on preventing illegal outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;505&quot; data-end=&quot;949&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The move follows a national meeting in Changsha attended by senior officials from ten central government agencies and representatives from seven mineral-rich provinces, including Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi. The meeting highlighted the need for integrated supervision across all links of the supply chain, calling for robust traceability systems, stronger customs inspections, and routine management mechanisms to detect and address risks early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;951&quot; data-end=&quot;1350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Authorities have pledged strict enforcement, with both central and local governments tasked with stepped-up oversight. Local jurisdictions are being directed to fast-track the registration and monitoring of businesses involved in strategic minerals, while companies are being urged to improve compliance awareness. Violators of the new measures will face severe penalties, according to the Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;951&quot; data-end=&quot;1350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Strategic minerals such as rare earths, lithium, graphite, and tungsten are critical for producing semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, military hardware, and clean energy technologies. Tighter Chinese controls are likely to strain global supply chains, raise costs for manufacturers, and intensify competition among countries seeking to secure stable, non-Chinese sources of these vital materials.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly is speaking soon, at 2140 GMT / 1740 US Eastern time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;participates in a fireside chat before the California Bankers Association 25th Annual Conference and Directors Forum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later we&apos;ll get the Australian employment report for April. It feels early in the month for this, but the data is due on the third Thursday of each month and its rolled around quickly this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solid, but not spectacular, job growth is expected to continue. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barring a surprise the AUD impact should be very limited. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its cash rate by 25bp again next week. The Bank meets on May 19 and 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It was more of a battle today but the bulls came out ahead. Newsflow was quiet today -- one of the quietest days of the year -- and that allowed the momentum trade to continue to tick higher. Big winners were in megacap tech and the usual retail-driven tech stocks while some biotech stocks were hit by selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 +0.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq Comp +0.7%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 -0.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DJIA -0.2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see there some divergence is creeping in but given the magnitude of recent moves, this was small potatoes. Tomorrow we get retail sales numbers and that could get things moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a glance at some of the winners and losers on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is on CNBC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s not even the beginning of a plan to do anything about the deficit until it&apos;s a crisis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DOGE talked about $2 trillion in savings, it maybe found $150 billion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs might raise $100 billion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don&apos;t understand why the trade deficit is a problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;ll be happy if gold goes to $3500, or $3800 but not if it goes to $30,000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The administration is &apos;building a retreat&apos;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don&apos;t see a great incentive for other countries to really negotiate with the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m pretty sure that in a few months we&apos;ll be talking about other things (than tariffs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don&apos;t think the USA is coming across as a reliable partner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he&apos;s short leveraged MSTR leveraged ETFs and hedged with a long MSTR. Explains it&apos;s a costly ETF to run because it can&apos;t use swaps and must buy high-priced options instead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn pitcked LanXess, a German chemical company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today,
 I’m presenting a company where the management has made excellent 
strategic decisions, but the stock has suffered due to a lot of bad 
luck,” he said. “The
 opportunity today is to realize that the troubles have largely passed 
and that the company is likely to be on a successful path to realizing 
the benefits of its transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;For at least the past 25 years, human traders have been anxious about being replaced by machines and yet -- today -- there are more people trading than ever. I&apos;d argue that many of them shouldn&apos;t be trading and note that many of the human tasks in markets have been replaced but the future is hard to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a cottage industry around writing and (mostly) selling trading algos. Their success has been mixed at best and it&apos;s mostly been an avenue for grift in the retail space but Jim Simons made ungodly amounts of money quant trading and relatively simplistic methods (though we don&apos;t know the details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, could this be the next frontier in trading technology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Google DeepMind today pulled the curtain back on AlphaEvolve,
 an artificial-intelligence agent that can invent brand-new computer 
algorithms — then put them straight to work inside the company’s vast 
computing empire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;AlphaEvolve pairs Google’s Gemini
 large language models with an evolutionary approach that tests, 
refines, and improves algorithms automatically. The system has already 
been deployed across Google’s data centers, chip designs, and AI 
training systems — boosting efficiency and solving mathematical problems
 that have stumped researchers for decades.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That description comes from a Venturebeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-alphaevolve-the-google-ai-that-writes-its-own-code-and-just-saved-millions-in-computing-costs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;on the DeepMind announcement today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the model combines the creativity of a large language model with algorithms 
that can scrutinize the model’s suggestions to filter and improve 
solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can almost guarantee that there are people pouring money into this idea in markets. Unfortunately, the same technology is going to be put to military use and we&apos;ll be lucky to survive it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) 📊 MARKETS NOW EXPECT 2 RATE CUTS IN 2025

Kalshi’s latest forecast shows 2 rate cuts priced in for 2025, a sharp reset from the 4–5 cuts expected earlier this year. Sticky inflation, tight labor markets, and cautious Fed guidance are forcing traders to rethink the easing cycle.

Is the market underestimating recession risks — or is the Fed done cutting?
