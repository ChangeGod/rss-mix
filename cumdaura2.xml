                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The visit will be in conjunction with the 2nd ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit that will take place on 27 May. The sources say that Chinese premier Li Qiang will be a high-profile attendee as Beijing hopes to rally more allies in fighting back against US tariffs. Li&apos;s visit will follow up on China president Xi&apos;s own visit to Malaysia as well from last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;One of the sources mentioned that trade is expected to be high on the agenda with regards to discussions during the summit. It is unclear if Li will also be in attendance for the ASEAN Summit itself, which will take place on 26 May in Malaysia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides the summit, Malaysia itself is an important strategic trade player caught in the US-China trade war. So, China&apos;s agenda here could be two-fold. For one, Malaysia is one of the more popular grounds for origin washing as noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/how-china-has-been-preparing-itself-ahead-of-this-tariffs-eventuality-with-the-us-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And after China, Malaysia is the next biggest exporter of rare earth minerals to the US. The gap between the two is massive of course but at around 13% (rest of the world ex China combined is only 17%), it&apos;s not an insignificant amount.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There is just one to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That being for EUR/USD at the 1.1300 level. It isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance though, so the impact might not be too striking. But amid a bit of a wait until we get to Trump&apos;s trade deal announcement, the expiries could help to provide a bit of a magnet for price action in the session ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But as has been the case in the past two to three weeks, it&apos;s all about trade headlines and the risk mood. So, those will remain as the key drivers of trading sentiment as we look to the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But as per the latest report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/wsj-trump-is-expected-to-announce-a-framework-of-a-trade-deal-with-the-uk-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that the so-called deal is just an agreement for negotiations to begin. It will just involve a framework for discussions over the coming weeks/months. So, we&apos;ll see about that. But as always, one can expect Trump to talk up a big game and that is keeping markets hopeful ahead of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Risk trades are holding up once again with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures now up 0.8%. That follows from the overnight gains but it was far from straightforward. The Fed stood their ground and that briefly saw US stocks pare gains before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-report-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;this late headline&lt;/a&gt; helped to salvage things. A word of caution of course that the devil is in the details regarding that report on chips but markets are running with it anyway for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Going back to Trump&apos;s announcement, it will be interesting to see how he wants to sell the narrative. The details will also be of much importance, so be on the lookout for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, it&apos;s still a case of buying the rumour. Will it end up being a sell the fact play before the end of today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s announcement is expected at 1400 GMT later.&lt;/p&gt;

It was
a relatively quiet headline day today with just a couple of nuggets. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Bank of Japan published the minutes of its March meeting. The Bank
left monetary policy unchanged at this meeting. There was debate
around the policy board table, summarised as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S.
tariff policies are seen as a key downside risk to Japan’s economy.
Some BOJ members thus urge caution in tightening policy further.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others
believe decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Its
unsurprising that there was some debate, with inflation in the country
having risen and real rates remaining very accommodative (negative!), but the cautious view prevailed, as it did again at the
subsequent meeting on April 30/May1 when policy was left once again
on hold. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;USD/JPY
didn’t do too much upon the release of the minutes, holding near
143.80 and thereabouts before drifting lower on the Trump
announcement later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Trump
posted to his own social media app that he will announce a “major”
trade deal on Thursday at 10am US Eastern time. US media (New York
Times) reports that the trade deal will be with the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
equity index futures traded higher on Globex on the back of the post
from Trump. Across major FX the USD lost some ground alongside. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Wall Street Journal took a more constrained view, reporting that 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“This
announcement is likely just an agreement to start the negotiations,
identifying a framework of issues to be discussed in the coming
months”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are responding to Trump more than the WSJ as I update, with US equity index futures extending their gains. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Uh-oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal is pouring some cold water on the earlier headlines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The announcement, which Trump teased late Wednesday on Truth Social as being with a “big, and highly respected country,” is expected to be a framework of an announcement with tariff adjustments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

“This announcement is likely just an agreement to start the negotiations, identifying a framework of issues to be discussed in the coming months,” said international trade attorney Tim Brightbill. “We suspect that tariff rates, non-tariff barriers, and digital trade are all on the list—and there are difficult issues to address on all of these.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolding is mine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-spruiks-a-major-trade-deal-announcement-thursday-morning-in-washington-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Trump spruiks a major trade deal announcement Thursday morning in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/pavlovs-dog-takes-us-equities-higher-on-trumps-major-trade-deal-teaser-announcement-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Pavlov&apos;s dog takes US equities higher on Trump&apos;s &quot;major trade deal&quot; teaser announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/new-york-times-says-trump-will-announce-a-trade-deal-with-the-uk-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;New York Times says Trump will announce a trade deal with the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I posted a summary of the Bank of Japan March meeting minutes here earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-minutes-bank-will-raise-rates-if-economic-and-price-projections-realised-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;BoJ minutes: Bank will raise rates if economic and price projections realised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that post you&apos;ll find some points being made in favour of staying on hold, and other points being made saying the Bank needs to able to respond quickly if needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters have summarised the minutes and say this divergence is views is a split. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOJ Split Over Next Rate Hike Amid U.S. Tariff Uncertainty

 Summary:

Bank of Japan policymakers were divided in March on when to raise rates again, as escalating U.S. tariff risks threatened Japan’s economic outlook.

While some called for caution, others argued the BOJ might still need to act decisively despite global uncertainties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Key Points:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
•  BOJ minutes reveal division over the pace of future rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  U.S. tariff policies are seen as a key downside risk to Japan’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  Some BOJ members urge caution in tightening policy further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

•  Others believe decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
•  The debate underscores rising pressure on Japan’s monetary strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think &apos;split&apos; is too strong a description. I think &apos;caution&apos; and &apos;decisive action may be necessary regardless of global risks&apos; are not, at this time, a split. The overall message from the minutes, and from subsequent BoJ communication, is that there is still time to watch and wait. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s Trump&apos;s announcement post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-spruiks-a-major-trade-deal-announcement-thursday-morning-in-washington-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Trump spruiks a major trade deal announcement Thursday morning in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times says now it&apos;ll be with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The U.S. and Britain have been in talks over lowering British tariffs on American cars and agricultural products, as well as removing UK digital taxes on U.S. tech firms. It remains unclear whether the deal is finalized or if it represents a framework for continued negotiations.
Unlike other countries, Britain was not hit with additional “reciprocal” tariffs due to its trade surplus with the U.S., though it remains subject to a 10% global tariff and a 25% levy on steel, aluminum, and cars. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK was my pick. But ... I don&apos;t know about anyone else but I&apos;ve lost count of how many times the NYT has been wrong about what to expect from Trump. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Info via Reuters report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;171&quot; data-end=&quot;333&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments are drafting plans for a sovereign wealth fund, though no final decisions have been made, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;335&quot; data-end=&quot;583&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The initiative, ordered by Trump in February, would aim to monetise government-held assets for public benefit and bolster economic security. A central feature under consideration is the use of tariff revenues as a core funding source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;585&quot; data-end=&quot;847&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly exploring a strategy that would leverage both liquid reserves and domestic assets, with the fund potentially combining investment and development functions — similar to sovereign wealth models used globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;849&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The White House said the proposal is part of the administration’s broader strategy to use every available tool to safeguard U.S. national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan minutes from its March policy meeting - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/minu_2025/g250319.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;full text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members agreed BOJ would continue to raise rates if its economy, price outlooks were to be realised&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said it’s appropriate to pay close attention to the new U.S. policies and their impact on the global economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said BoJ would need to be particularly cautious when considering the timing of next rate hike as downside risks stemming from U.S. policies had rapidly heightened&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said, even with heightened uncertainties, it did not warrant BoJ to be always cautious and BOJ may face a situation where it should act decisively&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said necessary to make nimble adjustments to the degree of monetary accommodation if it needed to avoid overheating of financial activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said that during the phase of the next policy interest rate hike, underlying CPI inflation might be fairly close to 2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said not necessary at this point to make any major changes to bond tapering plan when BOJ reviews its current plan in June&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That member also said BoJ would however need to examine from a longer-term perspective the reduction plan for April 2026 onward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said that given that U.S. Federal Reservesaid it was in no hurry to adjust policy stance, BoJ policy could be more flexible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier, the minutes not contradicting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the meeting minutes the Bank publishes its &apos;Summary of Opinions&apos;. For this meeting these can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-summary-of-opinions-march-meeting-20250327/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan Summary of Opinions of the March 18 and 19 meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting in March the Bank remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key points from the Summary were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BOJ will continue to hike rates if economy, prices move in line with forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside risks from the U.S. are heightening sharply and could have negative impacts on Japan’s economy, so we must be even more cautious on deciding next rate-hike timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downside risks to Japan’s economy are, in turn, heightening due to U.S. tariff policy, supply chain disruptions, so must keep policy steady for time being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those final two are why the Bank is on hold and looks like could be for another few meetings. The meeting that followed on May 1 also saw the Bank leave policy on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

In a note to clients, the bank said that persistent uncertainty around U.S. trade negotiations is weighing on business confidence and investment decisions, potentially tipping the economy into contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The longer uncertainty persists without any concrete progress on deals, the higher recession risk is, in our view, and we haven’t seen full capitulation,&quot; Barclays analysts wrote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;764&quot; data-end=&quot;961&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the bank continues to view a mild recession as the most probable scenario, it noted that such an outcome is “still avoidable if the trade war de-escalates quickly enough to prevent it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;963&quot; data-end=&quot;1275&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Barclays also flagged concerns over equity valuations, suggesting that further upside in stock prices is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. The bank cited downgrades in corporate earnings forecasts and what it described as “erratic” Trump policy execution as key headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;
