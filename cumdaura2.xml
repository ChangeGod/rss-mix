                            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday&apos;s soft 20-year auction and the resulting rout in equities has everyone watching bonds a bit more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front end of the curve is more-sensitive to the Fed and less sensitive to government debt but given the circumstances, next week&apos;s slate will still be watched closely:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, $69 billion of 2s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday $70 billion of 5s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thursday $44 billion of 7s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next sales of longer-dated debt will be 10s on June 11 and 30s on June 12.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;208&quot; data-end=&quot;518&quot;&gt;Freddie Mac weekly mortgage rate in the U.S. have edged higher, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rising to 6.86% for the week ending May 22, 2025, up from 6.81% the previous week.  This marks the highest level since mid-February, reflecting ongoing concerns over inflation and federal debt levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;208&quot; data-end=&quot;518&quot;&gt;Although higher it is below the 2025 high at 7.04% and the high from 2024 at 7.22%. The 2023 high reached 7.79%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;208&quot; data-end=&quot;518&quot;&gt;The low over the last few years? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;208&quot; data-end=&quot;518&quot;&gt;6.09% from September 2024. The low for 2025 reached 6.62% in the April week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;520&quot; data-end=&quot;633&quot;&gt;The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also rose to 6.01% from 5.92% .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;915&quot;&gt;Affordability remains a significant challenge for many prospective buyers. Elevated mortgage rates, combined with high home prices, continue to dampen buyer activity, even as more listings become available .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;915&quot;&gt;Yesterday, for the week ending May 16, 2025, U.S. MBA mortgage applications declined by 5.1%, reversing the prior week&apos;s 1.1% gain. The market index fell to 238.5 from 251.2, with both purchase applications and refinancing activity lower on the week. The purchase index dropped to 157.8 (from 166.5), and the refinance index declined to 682.5 (from 718.1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;756&quot; data-end=&quot;915&quot;&gt;Looking at the mortgage application index, it continues to waffle near the lows going back to 2004 with the more recent range between 165 and 296. The current value is at 238.50. The midipoint is 230.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1096&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1097&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1097&quot; data-end=&quot;1171&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1099&quot; data-end=&quot;1171&quot;&gt;30-year fixed mortgage rate: 6.86% (up from 6.81% last week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1172&quot; data-end=&quot;1246&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1174&quot; data-end=&quot;1246&quot;&gt;15-year fixed mortgage rate: 6.01% (up from 5.92%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1325&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1325&quot;&gt;Affordability challenges persist despite increased inventory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1544&quot;&gt;As the housing market navigates these developments, prospective buyers and industry stakeholders will be closely monitoring interest rate trends and policy decisions that could shape the landscape in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;296&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD continues to find solid support near the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart at 0.58957. This level has repeatedly attracted buyers, helping to stall the downside and keep the pair within a consolidative range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;538&quot; data-end=&quot;922&quot;&gt;To turn the tide more clearly in favor of the bulls, price needs to break above a cluster of resistance moving averages. That includes the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.59249, along with the 100- and 200-hour MAs just below and around the same region. This confluence of technical resistance has limited gains and remains a critical zone for upside continuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;924&quot; data-end=&quot;1113&quot;&gt;If the pair fails to hold above 0.58957, focus shifts to the 200-day moving average at 0.58798, which would represent a deeper corrective move and test the resolve of recent buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1120&quot; data-end=&quot;1153&quot;&gt;Key Technical Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1435&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1203&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1156&quot; data-end=&quot;1203&quot;&gt;Support: 200-bar MA (4-hour) at 0.58957&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1204&quot; data-end=&quot;1254&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1206&quot; data-end=&quot;1254&quot;&gt;Break level below: 200-day MA at 0.58798&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1255&quot; data-end=&quot;1349&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1257&quot; data-end=&quot;1349&quot;&gt;Resistance cluster: 100-bar MA (4-hour) at 0.59249, plus nearby 100/200-hour MAs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1350&quot; data-end=&quot;1435&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1352&quot; data-end=&quot;1435&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral-to-bullish above 0.58957, bullish confirmation only above 0.59249&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1437&quot; data-end=&quot;1602&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers continue to defend key support, but the battle lines are drawn at the MAs above. A breakout or breakdown from this tight range will dictate the next move.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;299&quot; data-end=&quot;635&quot;&gt;The USDJPY has rebounded from recent lows and is now stretching toward the first upside target zone — the high of a swing area and the 200-bar MA on the 4-hour chart near 144.097. This level marks the beginning of a cluster of closely stacked technical resistance levels that could slow or stall further upside momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;637&quot; data-end=&quot;864&quot;&gt;Above 144.097, traders will be watching the 50% retracement of the May range at 144.257, followed by the 100-hour moving average at 144.44. That MA has been declining and remains a barometer for short-term bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;Should bullish momentum continue, additional upside targets include the broken 38.2% retracement at 145.289 and the 200-hour moving average at 145.625. Each of these levels represents a technical hurdle that could either attract sellers or fuel continuation if broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;Conversely, if the sellers can lean here, that would keep the sellers more in control and have traders looking to the bottom of the swing area at 143.57 again followed by the 61.8% of the move up from the April low at 143.225. The price did break below that retracement level earlier today but found buyers near swing lows from May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1175&quot;&gt;Key technical levels ahead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1175&quot;&gt;RESISTANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1176&quot; data-end=&quot;1373&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1176&quot; data-end=&quot;1224&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1178&quot; data-end=&quot;1224&quot;&gt;144.097 – Swing high &amp;amp; 200-bar MA (4-hour)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1225&quot; data-end=&quot;1269&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1227&quot; data-end=&quot;1269&quot;&gt;144.257 – 50% retracement of May range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1270&quot; data-end=&quot;1304&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1272&quot; data-end=&quot;1304&quot;&gt;144.44 – Falling 100-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1345&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1345&quot;&gt;145.289 – Broken 38.2% retracement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1346&quot; data-end=&quot;1373&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1348&quot; data-end=&quot;1373&quot;&gt;145.625 – 200-hour MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUPPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;143.57 - Low of swing area&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;142.72 - 142.90 - Swing lows from May 7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;142.33 - Low for May&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1375&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers have momentum for now, but the cluster of resistance between 144.10 and 145.63 will be the true test of control. Holding below these levels could invite renewed selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was -5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; About half of firms (52%) reported their hiring plans for the remainder
 of 2025 have not changed since the beginning of the year, while 34% 
expect them to decrease and 14% expect to increase hiring plans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prices paid +34 vs +42 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prices received +17 vs +29 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite index -3 vs -4 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New orders for exports -21 vs -10 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has bounced around but it&apos;s above the -13 low in February. The pricing indexes improved from extreme levels in a sign that tariff angst has peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments in the survey:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Current business volume not sustainable long-term.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Some
 inventory we are reducing considerably due to significantly lower 
sales. Some inventory is quite a bit higher due to opportunity buys.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our
 business is in the biggest supply shortage in history. Demand is 
excellent at the moment, not sure how long that lasts given the 
shortages our customers are experiencing.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Year started strong but seems to be tapering off for at least the near term.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Domestic conditions are better, but still much potential for volatility.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Lots
 of uncertainty about landed costs of raw materials and capital 
expenditures. We will adjust who we buy from and what we charge our 
customers based on current situation, not future speculation.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Trade
 policy continues to impact business. The constant uncertainty around 
overall policy is negative for consumers and for us.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We
 are insourcing equipment builds which will drive growth and allow for 
us to purchase capex manufacturing equipment and hire three more 
employees.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;239&quot; data-end=&quot;462&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD has been confined within a narrow 191-pip range between 0.63216 and 0.6513 over the last 28 trading days. That is a relatively tight range, indicative of a market that is unsure of the next shove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;464&quot; data-end=&quot;859&quot;&gt;At the center of this range are the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, both of which are now nearly converged at 0.6439. Over the past several days, the price has been fluctuating above and below this moving average cluster, with each break lacking follow-through. Today, the pair has once again moved back below the MAs, tilting the short-term bias back to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;861&quot; data-end=&quot;1300&quot;&gt;The key question now is: Can sellers hold the price below the MAs and build momentum? The next key technical target comes in at the upward sloping trend line and the recent swing low near 0.6388, which has acted as a floor since last Friday. A break below that level would open the door toward the 200-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.63669. Below that, the support zone between 0.63216 and 0.63437 comes into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1302&quot; data-end=&quot;1610&quot;&gt;On the flip side, a move back above the 100/200-hour MAs at 0.6439 would shift attention to the 200-day moving average at 0.64532. The last four trading days have seen unsuccessful attempts to stay above that key long-term average, including a failed break again during today’s session highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1617&quot; data-end=&quot;1660&quot;&gt;Key Technical Highlights (Updated):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1661&quot; data-end=&quot;2082&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1661&quot; data-end=&quot;1715&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1663&quot; data-end=&quot;1715&quot;&gt;Range: 0.63216 to 0.6513 (191 pips over 28 days)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1716&quot; data-end=&quot;1779&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1718&quot; data-end=&quot;1779&quot;&gt;Current resistance zone: 100/200-hour MAs near 0.6439&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1780&quot; data-end=&quot;1836&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1782&quot; data-end=&quot;1836&quot;&gt;Upside target if broken: 200-day MA at 0.64532. Tries above the 200 day MA have failed recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1837&quot; data-end=&quot;1906&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1839&quot; data-end=&quot;1906&quot;&gt;Initial support: 0.6388 (swing low/floor since last Friday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1907&quot; data-end=&quot;1961&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1909&quot; data-end=&quot;1961&quot;&gt;Next support: 200-bar MA (4-hour) at 0.63669&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1962&quot; data-end=&quot;2009&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1964&quot; data-end=&quot;2009&quot;&gt;Broader support zone: 0.63216–0.63437&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2010&quot; data-end=&quot;2082&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2012&quot; data-end=&quot;2082&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.6439, with pressure building if 0.6388 fails&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2084&quot; data-end=&quot;2228&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;This technical standoff continues—momentum favors sellers, but they still need to take out key downside targets to gain clearer control.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a pronounced upward trend in the technology and communications sectors, with notable performances from key players. Here&apos;s a closer look at the dynamics shaping today&apos;s market landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📈 Technology Sector: Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are shining, up 1.24% and 1.07% respectively. This surge reflects renewed investor confidence in tech infrastructure and semiconductor innovation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📊 Communication Services: Google (GOOG) leads the pack with a substantial 4.02% increase, suggesting robust growth potential in the internet content and information sector. Meta Platforms (META) also shows a positive uptick of 0.73%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📉 Consumer Electronics: In contrast, Apple (AAPL) reports a dip of 0.81%, highlighting potential caution or strategic reassessment by investors in this segment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;⚙️ Industrials: Boeing (BA) impresses with a gain of 0.82%, standing out amid a generally flat performance across the industrials sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏠 Real Estate: The sector sees slight gains, led by Public Storage (PSA) at 0.66%, signaling stable interest in real estate investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market sentiment today exhibits cautious optimism, driven largely by strength in tech and communications. With leading tech corporations demonstrating resilience and growth, there&apos;s a palpable sense of long-term bullishness. However, mixed results in consumer-related sectors suggest a more nuanced view of market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor reactions are cautious yet positive, particularly towards tech innovations and digital services which continue to attract significant capital. This trend indicates potential momentum in these sectors, especially with stability returning after recent volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With today’s insights in mind, investors might consider the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification: Balance your portfolio by incorporating high-performing tech and communication service stocks while keeping an eye on emerging opportunities in real estate and industrials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk Management: Monitor consumer electronics closely against market shifts that may affect major players like Apple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus Areas: Given today&apos;s strong performances, prioritizing investments in innovative tech infrastructure and digital content service providers could be advantageous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay connected with real-time updates and in-depth analyses at ForexLive.com to make informed decisions and capitalize on evolving market dynamics. 📊📰&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US natural gas prices are down about 2% today after a bearish inventory report. Stockpiles rose by 120 bcf compared to 115 bpc as we get ready for the summer power burn season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natty is in an interesting spot at the moment and though prices have corrected since March, January futures remain just shy of $5 as LNG demand remains high and data center demand ramps up. The ongoing coal-to-gas switching is also continuing while lower oil prices mean less associated gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the best way to look at gas is via days of supply and this chart from TD highlights that we&apos;re about 18% below last year&apos;s level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing for gas prices from here would be a decline in WTI into the $50s as that&apos;s going to curb supply. Otherwise, it will all be about watching the weather and waiting for winter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FXIFY Celebrates 2 Years as Industry&apos;s First and Oldest Broker-Backed Prop Firm</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;FXIFY, the oldest broker-backed prop firm, is proud to celebrate
its second anniversary, marking two years of industry-defining innovation,
trader-first policies, and rapid global growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, FXIFY has paid out over $30 million to
its traders and now serves a global community of more than 200,000 active
users. In the first quarter of this year alone, a single trader received an
impressive $81,000 payout — a clear demonstration of the firm’s reliability and
commitment to delivering on payout promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t create FXIFY to follow the crowd,” says Peter
Brown, Co-Founder of FXIFY. “We built it to fix what was broken. Traders were
being strung along with gimmicks and delays. So we brought in real
infrastructure, cut out the nonsense, and gave traders something they could
actually rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FXIFY has led a shift in the industry by prioritising
transparency, efficiency, and speed. As the first and oldest broker-backed prop
firm, FXIFY introduced clear evaluation models and first payouts on demand
whilst eliminating common prop firm pain points like vague rules, delayed
payments, and inconsistent policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform supports multiple trading platforms familiar
to traders worldwide and offers flexible account structures suited to every
style and level. From instant funding programs to futures trading and classic
evaluation models, FXIFY has built an ecosystem that gives traders what they
need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its short history, FXIFY has already secured recognition
from International Business Magazine and ForexProp Reviews, among others, for
its outstanding contribution to the prop trading space. The firm’s highest
single payout to date stands at $117,000. One trader has successfully received

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;183&quot; data-end=&quot;445&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the EURUSD saw a bullish attempt as price moved above the 50% retracement level at 1.13183, but buyers failed to hold the break, turning momentum back toward the downside in the short term. That failure gave sellers a renewed edge, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;447&quot; data-end=&quot;832&quot;&gt;The pair is now approaching a key technical confluence area between 1.1258 and 1.12754. This zone has played a pivotal role recently—acting first as a floor, then as a ceiling, and now potentially a floor again. Within this range lies the rising 100-hour moving average and the broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the April high —adding further weight to its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;1132&quot;&gt;A hold above this support cluster keeps the pair in a neutral-to-bullish posture - negating the failure above the 50% retracement.  That potentially sets the stage for another upside attempt. However, a break below 1.1258 would shift the bias more clearly back to the downside, exposing further support levels at 1.1215 (the 200 hour MA) and a swing area between 1.11899 to 1.1213.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1134&quot; data-end=&quot;1158&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1159&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.13183 (50% Fib), 1.1362 (highs from yesterday), 1.1378 (61.8% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1217&quot; data-end=&quot;1273&quot;&gt;Support: 1.1258–1.12754 (key zone), 1.12157 (rising 200 hour MA), 1.11899 to 1.1213 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1275&quot; data-end=&quot;1402&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum is turning, and how price behaves around 1.1258–1.12754 will be critical in determining the next directional move/bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;168&quot; data-end=&quot;433&quot;&gt;The USDCHF found solid support yesterday at a key swing area near 0.81931 to 0.82120, a zone that had previously acted as a launchpad during the early May rally. Buyers leaned against that level yesterday, halting the recent downside momentum and triggering a bounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;435&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot;&gt;Today, the pair is moving modestly higher and is now testing a higher resistance zone — the swing area between 0.8272 and 0.82803. This level has been a recurring pivot in recent weeks (see red circles), with both buyers and sellers using it as a battleground. A break above this area would open the door toward the 100-hour MA (blue line currently near 0.8308) and the 38.2% retracement level of the May range at 0.83087.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;1092&quot;&gt;Staying below 0.82803 keeps the near-term bias more neutral-to-bearish, especially as the price remains under the 100 hour MA, the 38.2% retracement and the downward sloping trendline. Conversely, a break above the current resistance zone could shift momentum further in favor of the bulls but with those targets looming above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1094&quot; data-end=&quot;1118&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1119&quot; data-end=&quot;1168&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1121&quot; data-end=&quot;1168&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8257(50% retracement). 0.8193 to 0.8212 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1169&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1171&quot; data-end=&quot;1260&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8272–0.82803 (current test), 0.8308 (100 hour MA, and 38.2% Fib), 0.83509 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1372&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is at a pivotal juncture — the response at current levels will help define the next directional bias.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 51.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing 52.3 vs 50.1 expected -- best one-month jump since June 2022&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior manufacturing was 50.7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite 52.1 vs 51.2 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rise in
inventories of purchases was the largest recorded in
the 18-year survey history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a nice rebound into solidly positive territory, no doubt due to lower tariffs and a rebound in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is worrisome, though not that surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Average prices charged for goods and services jumped
higher in May, rising at a rate not witnessed since
August 2022. An especially steep rise was seen for manufacturers’
selling prices, which posted the largest monthly
increase since September 2022. Charges levied for
services rose to the greatest extent since April 2023
The latest rise in output prices was overwhelmingly
linked to tariffs, having directly driven up the cost of
imported inputs or caused suppliers to pass through
tariff-related cost increases. Manufacturing input costs
rose at the sharpest rate since August 2022 while
service sector costs rose at the fastest rate since June
2023&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is Chris Williamson,
Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Business confidence has improved in May from the
worrying slump seen in April, with gloom about prospects
for the year ahead lifting somewhat thanks largely to the
pause on higher rate tariffs. Current output growth has
also picked up from April’s recent low, which had seen
the weakest rise for over one-and-a-half years, in
response to an upturn in demand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“However, both sentiment and output growth remain
relatively subdued, and at least some of the upturn in
May can be linked to companies and their customers seeking to front-run further possible tariff-related
issues, most notably the potential for future tariff hikes
after the 90-day pause lapses in July. In particular,
concerns over tariff-related supply shortages and price
rises led to the largest accumulation of input inventories
recorded since survey data were first available 18 years
ago.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Supply chain delays are now more prevalent than at any
time since the pandemic led to widespread shortages in
2022, and prices charged for both goods and services
have spiked higher as firms and their suppliers seek to
pass on tariff levies to customers. The overall rise in
prices charged for goods and services in May was the
steepest since August 2022, which is indicative of
consumer price inflation moving sharply higher.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Stocks appear to be keying off the dip in Treasury yields. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now flat after a 30 point round trip in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bounce comes after US 30-year yields backed off the 2023 high of 5.17% and are down to 5.11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One good sign I would note in the pre-market movers is Urban Outfitters, which is up +17% after strong earnings and revenue beat. The clothing company highlighted a strong consumer in something of a pushback to the weakness at Target yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the noise in the headlines and the broader economic uncertainty, our customers continued to show resilience in Q1. We haven&apos;t seen any signs of a demand slowdown,&quot; said Richard Hayne, CEO. “May to date, we see the comp sales being very similar to the Q1 print.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company left its guidance unchanged and anticipates 10% global tariffs with 30% from China. The company said it was &quot;definitely considering&quot; raising prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some other pre-market movers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advance Auto Parts +30% on smaller-than-expected loss and revenue beat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nike +1% after announcing return to Amazon and price hikes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humana -6% on Medicare Advantage audit concerns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CVS Health -4% on Medicare audit news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UnitedHealth -3% on Medicare audit news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analog Devices +3% after beating Q2 earnings and revenue estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lumen Technologies +9% after AT&amp;amp;T deal for fiber business&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AT&amp;amp;T flat on Lumen acquisition news&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snowflake +8% after earnings beat and strong guidance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunrun -30% on Republican tax bill impact on clean energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enphase, SolarEdge -17%, Array -10%, Nextracker -4%, First Solar -1% on solar sector selloff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zoom -1% despite earnings beat and solid forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pitney Bowes +9% after naming Kurt Wolf as new CEO&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;114&quot; data-end=&quot;477&quot;&gt;The USDCAD broke above a key resistance level at 1.3904 on May 8, marking the end of a multi-week consolidation range. Two days later, the pair tested the 200-day moving average near 1.4015, a critical technical barrier. Sellers leaned against that level on back-to-back sessions, preventing a sustained breakout and triggering a reversal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;479&quot; data-end=&quot;845&quot;&gt;By May 14, the price had fallen back to retest the former breakout point at 1.3904. What had served as a ceiling turned into a floor — temporarily. However, that floor gave way in yesterday’s session, with the pair falling back into the prior consolidation zone between 1.37497 and 1.3904, where price had been trapped from April 16 to May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;847&quot; data-end=&quot;1014&quot;&gt;Now, the old support at 1.3904 has reestablished itself as resistance. As long as the pair stays below 1.3904, the bias remains tilted to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1016&quot; data-end=&quot;1425&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, watch 1.38607 for near-term support. This level marked swing highs on May 1, was broken on May 8 during the upside breakout, and acted as a launchpad for the May highs (as indicated by the green circles). In the current session, the latest bounce also stalled at that level. A move below 1.38607 could invite more selling pressure and further bearish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US dollar firms after initial jobless claims, 30-year yields can&apos;t crack 2023 high</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar found some modest bids after initial jobless claims edged lower. The reading of 227K was slightly below the 230K consensus and 229K last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no sign of weakening in the US jobs market in the weekly data and that&apos;s likely to firm the Fed&apos;s resolve to wait before cutting rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar rose afterwards, climbing around a dozen pips against the yen, with the euro falling by a similar margin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market was another likely culprit. US 30-year yields tested the 2023 high of 5.17% just ahead of the data and reached 5.16% before pulling back a couple basis points. That may have eased some angst about runaway borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 2023 high breaks, US long-term borrowing costs will be the highest since 2007 and that will be a tough blow for the housing market in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior week initial jobless claims 229K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial jobless claims 227K vs 230K estimate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 week moving average initial jobless claims 231.5K vs 230.5K last week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior week continuing claims 1.881M revised to 1.867M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing claims 1.903M vs 1.885M estimate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4- week MA 1,887.5 vs 1,870M last week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 10 (last week) were in Massachusetts (+3,410), Virginia (+1,272),
Pennsylvania (+595), Illinois (+442), and Nebraska (+395), while the largest decreases were in Michigan (-5,827),
California (-1,861), Ohio (-868), New York (-859), and New Hampshire (-475). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial jobless claims data is for the job survey week.  The data is consistent with steady jobs report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuing claims to move back above the 1.9 million level which is the second reading about that level in recent history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on interest rates and they are not contributing with the 2 year down -1.9 basis points, but the 10-year up 1.6 basis points at 4.612% (the high yield reached 4.627%). That is the highest level since Feb 12. The high yield for the year was up at 4.809% back on January 13. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is mixed, but little changed vs the 3 major currency pairs to kickstart the US session .  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the major pairs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EURUSD is down -0.16% (higher USD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USDJPY is also down by -0.26% (lower USD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GBPUSD is unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest mover is the NZDUSD which has taken a tumble in the European morning session and is now down -0.59% (higher USD). The AUDUSD is down -0.20% (higher USD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the Tax and Spending Reconciliation Bill by a 215–214 vote, with Republicans Massie and Davidson voting against it and HFC Chair Harris abstaining by voting &quot;Present.&quot; Representatives Schweikert and Garbarino did not vote. The legislation now heads to various Senate committees and will eventually be debated and voted on in the full Senate—a process expected to take several weeks. If it passes, former President Trump will have his big beautiful bill, but will the markets like it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US yields are voting and it is not supportive.  On the longer end, yields moved up double digits yesterday with the yield curve steepening sharply. Looking at the treasury curve, the yield curve is steeper again with the 2-year down -2.7 basis points, while the 10 year is up 1.6 basis points. The 2-10 year spread is up to 62.5 basis points, just a few basis points from the 64.8 basis point recent high (and highest level since January 2022) reached on April 21.  The snapshot shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.990%, -2.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.142%, -1.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.612%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 yar yield 5.144%, +5.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US stock indices, the earlier pre-market gains are being eroded fast with the Nasdaq moving from about +40 points to down -92 points over just the last hour of trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow dow -221 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P down -28 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq -92 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is down -$1.00 at $60.63. OPEC+ is discussing an increase in production for July. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is down -$5.13 or -0.14% at $3312.60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is up $1000 at $110,704. A new record high was reached $111,888 before a modest rotation lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
