                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Info via Reuters report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;171&quot; data-end=&quot;333&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments are drafting plans for a sovereign wealth fund, though no final decisions have been made, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;335&quot; data-end=&quot;583&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The initiative, ordered by Trump in February, would aim to monetise government-held assets for public benefit and bolster economic security. A central feature under consideration is the use of tariff revenues as a core funding source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;585&quot; data-end=&quot;847&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly exploring a strategy that would leverage both liquid reserves and domestic assets, with the fund potentially combining investment and development functions — similar to sovereign wealth models used globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;849&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The White House said the proposal is part of the administration’s broader strategy to use every available tool to safeguard U.S. national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan minutes from its March policy meeting - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/minu_2025/g250319.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;full text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members agreed BOJ would continue to raise rates if its economy, price outlooks were to be realised&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said it’s appropriate to pay close attention to the new U.S. policies and their impact on the global economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said BoJ would need to be particularly cautious when considering the timing of next rate hike as downside risks stemming from U.S. policies had rapidly heightened&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said, even with heightened uncertainties, it did not warrant BoJ to be always cautious and BOJ may face a situation where it should act decisively&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said necessary to make nimble adjustments to the degree of monetary accommodation if it needed to avoid overheating of financial activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said that during the phase of the next policy interest rate hike, underlying CPI inflation might be fairly close to 2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said not necessary at this point to make any major changes to bond tapering plan when BOJ reviews its current plan in June&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That member also said BoJ would however need to examine from a longer-term perspective the reduction plan for April 2026 onward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said that given that U.S. Federal Reservesaid it was in no hurry to adjust policy stance, BoJ policy could be more flexible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier, the minutes not contradicting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the meeting minutes the Bank publishes its &apos;Summary of Opinions&apos;. For this meeting these can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-summary-of-opinions-march-meeting-20250327/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan Summary of Opinions of the March 18 and 19 meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting in March the Bank remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key points from the Summary were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BOJ will continue to hike rates if economy, prices move in line with forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside risks from the U.S. are heightening sharply and could have negative impacts on Japan’s economy, so we must be even more cautious on deciding next rate-hike timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downside risks to Japan’s economy are, in turn, heightening due to U.S. tariff policy, supply chain disruptions, so must keep policy steady for time being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those final two are why the Bank is on hold and looks like could be for another few meetings. The meeting that followed on May 1 also saw the Bank leave policy on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;201&quot; data-end=&quot;578&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Barclays is warning that the U.S. economy remains on course for a recession, with the likelihood increasing as global trade tensions continue to simmer without resolution. In a note to clients, the bank said that persistent uncertainty around U.S. trade negotiations is weighing on business confidence and investment decisions, potentially tipping the economy into contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The longer uncertainty persists without any concrete progress on deals, the higher recession risk is, in our view, and we haven’t seen full capitulation,&quot; Barclays analysts wrote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;764&quot; data-end=&quot;961&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the bank continues to view a mild recession as the most probable scenario, it noted that such an outcome is “still avoidable if the trade war de-escalates quickly enough to prevent it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;963&quot; data-end=&quot;1275&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Barclays also flagged concerns over equity valuations, suggesting that further upside in stock prices is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. The bank cited downgrades in corporate earnings forecasts and what it described as “erratic” Trump policy execution as key headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;

The Federal Reserve Rates unchanged. In their statement, the Fed did acknowledge that there was a higher risk of unemployment moving higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;tldr text-body article__tldr bold&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-body tldr__item bold&quot;&gt;&quot;The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;753&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;During his press conference,Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious and data-dependent tone in his May 7 remarks, balancing acknowledgment of economic resilience with concerns about elevated uncertainty. While Powell described the U.S. economy as “solid” and the labor market as “broadly in balance” and consistent with maximum employment, he also pointed to sharp declines in consumer and business sentiment and noted that many households and firms are postponing decisions. The effects of recent policy shifts—especially in trade, immigration, and regulation—remain unclear, with tariffs cited as significantly larger than expected. Powell warned that if sustained, these tariffs could drive inflation, either temporarily or persistently, depending on how circumstances evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;755&quot; data-end=&quot;1413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inflation remains somewhat elevated, but Powell emphasized that the Fed’s goal is to ensure any price increases from policy shocks like tariffs do not become entrenched. He reiterated that the current stance of monetary policy is well-positioned to respond as needed but stressed there is time to wait before adjusting rates. The cost of waiting, he noted, is “fairly low.” During the Q&amp;amp;A session, Powell underscored that the implications of current risks are still unknown and that the Fed doesn’t yet have enough clarity to determine if cuts are appropriate. He acknowledged cases where no cuts may be warranted, and others where easing could be justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1415&quot; data-end=&quot;1885&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the rising downside risks—including the potential for both higher inflation and higher unemployment—Powell said recent data, such as initial jobless claims, do not yet reflect broad economic deterioration. Still, the Fed is closely watching for any material impacts in the data and stands ready to act when greater clarity emerges. Overall, the message was clear: the Fed remains patient, pragmatic, and guided by unfolding evidence rather than preemptive moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1415&quot; data-end=&quot;1885&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;US stocks traded higher and lower through the press conference but was extended to the downside after Powell was finished. However just before the close there were reports from Bloomberg that Pres. Trump will not enforce the AI diffusion rule on chip exports. That sent chip stocks higher and the major indices along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1415&quot; data-end=&quot;1885&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, Nvidia shares rose $3.52 to $117.06 after trading as low as $112.28.&lt;/p&gt;

Seems Ukraine has enough to consider for now. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;172&quot; data-end=&quot;758&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Major U.S. equity indices ended the day in positive territory after a choppy session marked by sharp swings in tech stocks and shifting investor sentiment around trade and Fed policy. Early pressure came from weakness in Alphabet and Apple shares, following comments from Apple’s VP of Services indicating that search and browser usage declined in April—the first drop on record. In response, Apple is reportedly exploring the integration of AI-powered search in its browsers, a move that could threaten Alphabet’s search revenue, given its long-standing default search deal with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;760&quot; data-end=&quot;1210&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets briefly turned higher after the Fed policy decision, only to retreat following Fed Chair Powell’s press conference, where he emphasized elevated uncertainty and a data-dependent stance. However, a late-session boost came after reports that President Trump may rescind global chip export restrictions amid ongoing debate around AI-related controls. That headline sent semiconductor stocks sharply higher, lifting the broader indices with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1212&quot; data-end=&quot;1286&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the close, all major indices posted gains for the first time this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1289&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average: +284.97 points (+0.70%) to 41,113.97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1362&quot; data-end=&quot;1413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1364&quot; data-end=&quot;1413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500: +24.37 points (+0.43%) to 5,631.28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1414&quot; data-end=&quot;1475&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1416&quot; data-end=&quot;1475&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NASDAQ Composite: +48.50 points (+0.27%) to 17,738.16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1476&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1478&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Russell 2000: +6.47 points (+0.33%) to 1,989.66&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple closed down $-2.26 or -1.14% at $196.25.

                            &lt;p&gt;The minutes from the Bank of Japan due today are for the March meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the meeting minutes the Bank publishes its &apos;Summary of Opinions&apos;. For this meeting these can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-summary-of-opinions-march-meeting-20250327/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan Summary of Opinions of the March 18 and 19 meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting in March the Bank remained on hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key points from the Summary were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BOJ will continue to hike rates if economy, prices move in line with forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside risks from the U.S. are heightening sharply and could have negative impacts on Japan’s economy, so we must be even more cautious on deciding next rate-hike timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downside risks to Japan’s economy are, in turn,  heightening due to U.S. tariff policy, supply chain disruptions, so must keep policy steady for time being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those final two are why the Bank is on hold and looks like could be for another few meetings. The meeting that followed on May 1 also saw the Bank leave policy on hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result.

                            &lt;p&gt;The seller of the USDJPY tried, but the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart found support buyers. The low reached 142.89.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inability to move lower, gave the buyers the go-ahead to push higher, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price moved up toward the 100-bar MA at 143.953 on the 4-hour chart after moving through the 200 hour MA at 143.51. The high reached 143.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those bookends helps to tell a story of the Fed too. The Fed Chair does not know what to expect except perhaps he is tilted to the downside. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Some headlines are crossing about the Trump administration rescinding chip curbs and both the Nasdaq and Nvidia have jumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump will not enforce the AI diffusion rule set to take effect May 15&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a Biden-era rule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It comes ahead of a Middle East trip where Saudi Arabia and the UAE have bristled at restrictions on acquiring chips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump officials are working on a new rule that would strengthen control of chips abroad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even with removing this, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries have faced chip exports controls since 2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could be part of a bigger deal as the UAE has pledged to invest as much as $1.4 trillion in US technology and infrastructure over the next decade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-amid-ai-restrictions-debate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Full report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market got very excited about this but it&apos;s more about chip shipments to the Middle East/India and it presumably doesn&apos;t effect tariffs or restrictions on shipping chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the market initially read this as Trump taking tariffs off chips but that&apos;s not what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US dollar rallies through the FOMC decision and press conference</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar caught a solid bid in the back half of the press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and I&apos;m not quite sure why. The moves aren&apos;t huge but in the 20-30 pip range including a 70 pip bounce in USD/JPY from an initial dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming message from the FOMC was that they don&apos;t know what they will do next, are watching data and are prepared to move quickly when they get a clearer picture. But also that they think the economy is currently strong, despite negative GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, the tone was hawkish and that should lead to US dollar bids. The chance of a Fed rate hike in June is down to 22% and July is at 85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the bond market isn&apos;t exactly validating the dollar move. US 2-year yields are flat on the day and 10s are down 4.5 bps and near the lows of the day. Stocks are flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sympathetic to the idea that the Fed will inevitably fall behind the curve because they&apos;re navigating a very unusual and fluid set of circumstances. But I was also impressed with Powell&apos;s defense of the US economy and confidence that the underlying fundamentals are good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the market will quickly shifts its focus back to the trade war and that&apos;s likely what is causing the cross currents today.&lt;/p&gt;
