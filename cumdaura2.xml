                            &lt;p&gt;At least one person got a new job in Canada in April -- Mark Carney -- today we will get a better sense of the economy he inherited with the April jobs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are clear signs of a slowdown in the Canadian economy with a drop in confidence and I&apos;m particularly worried about falling house prices. That said, the consumer has been holding up and announced layoffs have been modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s report is expected to show 2.5K new jobs following a loss of 32.6K in March. Unemployment is expected to tick up to 6.8% from 6.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks to the Canadian dollar are straight forward with the market pricing in a 46% chance of a cut at the June 4 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the video above, I take a technical look at the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD to kickstart the US forex trading day. What levels are in play and why.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed officials can now speak after the Fed decision on Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said first-quarter growth data reflected frontloading of activity ahead of anticipated tariffs, adding that it&apos;s still unclear how trade policy will evolve. While she sees some upside risk to inflation from the tariffs, she noted the economy has remained resilient, giving the Fed room to continue its gradual approach to bringing inflation down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed Governor Michael Barr warned that President Trump’s sweeping new tariffs will likely raise inflation, slow economic growth, and increase unemployment later this year, putting the Fed in a tough spot if both inflation and joblessness rise. He emphasized that the full impact of the tariffs remains uncertain but noted they could cause lasting supply chain disruptions and strain small businesses. Barr reiterated the Fed’s “wait-and-see” stance, saying policy is well-positioned to adjust as conditions evolve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after a UK trade deal, Pres. Trump is saying an 80% tariff on China &quot;seems right&quot; but added it would ultimately be up to Treasury Secretary Bessent (or Scott B as he posted) to decide. The US and China will meet in Switzerland this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Senior Trade Advisor Navarro is on the wires saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markets should expect an active weekend with a steady flow of trade deals, which will be handled on a country-by-country basis. He highlighted the UK deal as a promising template for future agreements, especially in areas like agriculture. Regarding the EU, Navarro criticized recent retaliatory rhetoric and said while the EU is not low on the priority list, its actions—such as “firing shots across our bow”—are unfortunate and unhelpful to ongoing trade discussions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada jobs data will be released at 8:30 AM ET, with employment change est at 2.5K vs -32.6K last month. THe unemployment rate is expected at 6.8% vs 6.7% last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks in pre-market trading are higher as per the futures prices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow up 64 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P up 15.06 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq +65 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are mixed with the short end lower, and the higher end higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.863% -3.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.983%, -1.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.388%, +1.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.861%, +0.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the 3 and 10 year note auctions were solid, but the 30 year bond auction yesterday was not so great (positive tail and lower bid to cover). &lt;/p&gt;

That before making sure that if anything goes south, Bessent would be pushed under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the immediate aftermath, markets are not all too sure what to make of the headline. The figure is higher than the 50% touted in reports yesterday but whether 50% or 80%, it&apos;s a mere numbers game. If the idea is to get China to the negotiating table, it&apos;s not going to work surely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;US futures whipsawed on the headline before dipping a little lower to pare gains. But as we continue to digest the situation, S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now back a little higher up by 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar is less enthused though, with USD/JPY now down 0.5% to 145.15 and EUR/USD up 0.2% on the day to 1.1250 levels. Meanwhile, USD/CHF is also lower by 0.1% to 0.8310 while AUD/USD has pared earlier losses to be flat at 0.6400 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, bonds are holding lower as well with 10-year yields now up to 4.39% and 30-year yields up to 4.87% on the day. Then, we have gold also keeping higher by 0.9% to $3,334 as traders continue to digest what this all means ahead of US-China talks tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s going to be an interesting end to the week, not least with market players eyeing more trade headlines before the end of the day. We&apos;ll also have to watch out for positioning plays ahead of US-China talks, as that could lead to a significant gap on either side at the open on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;98&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fed’s Kugler Flags Diverging Forces: Tariffs May Fuel Inflation While Weak Demand Slows Growth
Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler highlighted the complex economic picture facing policymakers, noting that while headline GDP contracted by 0.3%, private domestic final purchases (PDFP) — a key gauge of consumer and business activity — grew at a solid 3%, signaling underlying resilience. However, early signs of tariff-related inflation and weakening confidence suggest headwinds ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;513&quot; data-end=&quot;1002&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Financial Implications:
Markets face a dual risk: tariffs could reignite inflation via higher input costs, particularly in goods, while weakening sentiment and slowing real incomes could drag down demand. This mix complicates the Fed’s outlook — inflation pressures may persist even as unemployment ticks higher. For equities, especially rate-sensitive sectors, this stagflationary risk profile is bearish. Manufacturing input costs and supply chain shifts may also weigh on margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1004&quot; data-end=&quot;1030&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Metrics/Details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1031&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1031&quot; data-end=&quot;1060&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1033&quot; data-end=&quot;1060&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;GDP (headline): -0.3%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1061&quot; data-end=&quot;1115&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1063&quot; data-end=&quot;1115&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;PDFP (private domestic final purchases): +3.0%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1116&quot; data-end=&quot;1223&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1118&quot; data-end=&quot;1223&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Early indicators: Regional Fed surveys and ISM data show rising input costs, particularly in goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1224&quot; data-end=&quot;1304&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1304&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consumer sentiment: Falling confidence despite high recent retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1307&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Outlook: Real income and asset value declines expected to suppress demand; productivity may fall due to supply chain reshoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1440&quot; data-end=&quot;1854&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investor Takeaway:
Investors should brace for policy complexity: the Fed may face inflationary pressure from tariffs at the same time that labor market weakness begins to bite. This reduces the likelihood of aggressive rate cuts, especially if goods inflation persists. Positioning should account for margin pressure in manufacturing and consumer cyclicals, while demand weakness may favor defensive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1861&quot; data-end=&quot;2103&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This article was generated at ForexLive.com (evolving to be investingLive.com at the end of this year) with the assistance of AI and may contain factual or contextual inaccuracies.

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limited economic reaction to tariffs partly reflects expectations of looser BOE policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should not neglect longer-term upward pressures on inflation from wages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Careful&quot; rate cuts should be understood to represent being alert, agile to economic changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is still some way to go on disinflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This is a rather soft defense of his position to not want to cut rates in yesterday&apos;s vote. But as mentioned then, the BOE system does shed more transparency on the same discussion that all central banks are facing right now. If even the UK is seeing such a debate, what more other major central banks like the Fed and ECB.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&quot;80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;m not sure how exactly it is up to Bessent when Trump himself is already saying that it should be 80%. Funny. US futures are hitting a bit of a whipsaw on the headline here but at the balance, is nudging lower. Gold is also catching a bid, touching a high of $3,338 while USD/JPY is now down 0.5% to 145.10 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 80% figure is higher than what was reported yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/white-house-weighing-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-report-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But again, whether at 50% or 80%, the effect is more or less the same still. If the idea is to get China to the negotiating table, then it wouldn&apos;t work. So, is Trump just sending Bessent up for slaughter here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The bigger picture continues to allude to the potential idea that Trump&apos;s tariffs are designed in a fashion to pursue further decoupling in US-China relations. The 10% tariffs elsewhere are also acting as an off-ramp for Trump in allowing for US firms to chase alternatives and substitutes in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

He added that it&apos;s up to the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to decide the appropriate rate, as he&apos;s the one in charge of trade negotiations with China, but it still shows that Trump is favouring a more aggressive approach.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;95&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets on Edge as U.S.-China Tariff Talks Loom — and Limited Progress May Disappoint Investors
Investors are entering the weekend with caution as U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled, with expectations centered around potential tariff reductions. Markets have partially priced in a move from the current 145% peak tariff rate on Chinese imports to something in the 50% range. However, recent commentary from U.S. officials and analysts suggests little substantive progress is likely this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;1013&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Financial Implications:
If the talks result only in an agreement to keep talking — without a concrete reduction in tariffs — equity markets may react negatively on Monday. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has already staged a strong 13–14% rally, and positioning remains slightly long-to-neutral. Failure to deliver a tangible outcome could trigger a pullback, particularly given how much optimism is now priced in. Conversely, even a small policy shift toward a 50–60% tariff rate could sustain risk sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1015&quot; data-end=&quot;1041&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investors and Traders, Have the Following in Mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1042&quot; data-end=&quot;1461&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1042&quot; data-end=&quot;1141&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1044&quot; data-end=&quot;1141&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 13–14% since recent lows, and April marked its second-best month of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1142&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current tariffs on some Chinese goods peak at 145%; Some analysts anticipate a drop to 50–60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1235&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1237&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A baseline global tariff rate of 10% is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1297&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1299&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some companies have removed forward guidance, citing uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1367&quot; data-end=&quot;1461&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1461&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Airlines, autos, and consumer durables may feel the pinch from persistent price pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1463&quot; data-end=&quot;1894&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investor Takeaway:
With markets trading just 3.7% below pre-April highs, the risk-reward balance going into the weekend skews slightly bearish if no progress is made. A delay or disappointment could revive volatility early next week, especially with CPI and a court ruling on tariff powers due May 13. Investors should be prepared for a market response that reflects how real the outcomes of this weekend&apos;s meetings appear. On the other hand, Trump may push forward with continued momentum after the US-UK deal, disappointing the short sellers betting on a disappointment. Monday&apos;s stock market open will be quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The US-UK trade deal agreement stole the spotlight yesterday but it hardly was what led Wall Street to rally. The framework for the deal lacked meaningful details but is at least a step in the right direction. Instead, the most important headline was arguably these remarks by Trump:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TRUMP: BETTER GO OUT AND BUY STOCKS NOW &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TRUMP: THE STOCK MARKET WILL REALLY RALLY NOW&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That turned the more tepid mood after the US-UK trade announcement to a strong rally before US stocks ended the day with middling gains. The mood music was also affected by other headlines, with talk of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-says-template-for-10-tariffs-is-probably-the-lowest-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;10% blanket tariffs being the floor for any deal&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps more importantly the report by the Wall St Journal suggesting that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/white-house-weighing-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-report-20250508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;US is looking to cut China tariffs to as low as 50%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latter is perhaps the most important headline to watch out for as we gear towards US-China talks over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With Trump having touted to &quot;go out and buy stocks&quot;, one can expect him to deliver something in the day ahead to vindicate his own message. And a show of goodwill by lowering China tariffs might be just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And let&apos;s face it, markets will lap it all up as the buy the rumour trade goes into overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, make no mistake. Even at 50-60% tariff levels, there&apos;s still much pain and friction still in play with regards to US-China trade. Sure, there are exemptions and workarounds to circumvent the tariffs. And the 10% blanket tariffs elsewhere are basically an off-ramp for Trump as trade with China is facing a stall. It essentially allows for US firms to seek alternatives and substitutes but again, these things take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The thing here is that while markets might find comfort in Trump offering &quot;relief&quot; on tariffs and a &quot;friendlier&quot; gesture towards China before talks, it&apos;s still a big question mark as to whether Beijing will be willing to see that as a positive step. If anything, one would expect China to want all tariffs taken off the table before sitting down to talk. And that&apos;s a risk to watch out for going into the talks over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So even with a supposed gesture of goodwill by reducing tariffs to 50-60%, it&apos;s not necessarily going to be an inviting proposition for China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The bigger picture points to some form of further decoupling between the two countries and that&apos;s not optimistic for the global economy. But again, that&apos;s something that markets will need time to digest and to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;When you take a step back, it&apos;s rather amazing what Trump has managed to achieved in the last month or so. He has pretty much hoodwinked markets into accepting 10% blanket tariffs as a good thing, not to mention the likely further decoupling between US and China in the meantime. It&apos;s pretty much Stockholm syndrome at its finest and given the playbook above, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see markets take to it again later today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs to lead to higher inflation and lower growth in US and abroad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump tariffs are without modern precedent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given economic strength, monetayr policy is in a good position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m concerned that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic outlook clouded by trade policies that have increased uncertainty, hurt consumers and business sentiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just token remarks by Barkin as nobody at the Fed seems to be willing to offer anything in terms of forward guidance or at least personal expectations. Only Fed&apos;s Waller laid out what would be his strategy depending on the tariffs outcome and right now his &quot;more hawkish&quot; scenario is playing out. It remains to be seen though if other countries will accept the 10% tariff rate or take a harder stance.&lt;/p&gt;

This is because the certainty around the 10% global rate has increased after the US-UK trade deal and it&apos;s also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/federal-reserve-governor-wallers-strategy-for-dealing-with-tariffs-20250415/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;&quot;more hawkish&quot; scenario&lt;/a&gt; for the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have now reached the peak in the &quot;de-escalation trade&quot; and the focus will likely switch to the language from other countries, especially the EU. Will they take a harder stance and oppose categorically the 10% floor? &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is being reported that India is offering to slash its tariffs gap with the US to below 4% (currently 13%) in exchange for an exemption to Trump&apos;s tariffs. To achieve that, India is said to be offering to reduce duties to zero on 60% of tariff lines in the first phase of the deal. This will help to reduce the average tariff differential between the two countries by about 9% in favour of the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For some context, India was slapped with an initial 26% tariffs before the 90-day pause as they run a large trade surplus of $45.7 billion with the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;One of the sources also add that India has offered preferential access to almost 90% of goods imported from the US, including the reduced tariffs. And considering where they are in talks, India and Japan are the next two countries in line to finalise a deal. The source says that &quot;we will see which one crosses the line first&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;m not sure being able to brag about getting a deal that quickly is all that is cracked up to be in this circumstance. It&apos;s more important to be getting the right deal. And what this says essentially is that India is asking for a full tariffs exemption while offering a host of concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We&apos;ll see how that works since Trump and Lutnick have both said that 10% tariffs are &quot;the best&quot; one can get. It&apos;s amazing how at the end of this all, Trump has hoodwinked the world into accepting 10% blanket tariffs across the board as being a good thing. Talk about Stockholm syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our commitment to the 2% inflation target is unwavering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is good we have a diversity of views on MPC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will use scenarios as vehicles for exploring risks around the baseline and accomodating differences of views on the committee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest choice of BoE scenarios does not mean inflation risk skewed in one direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are on course to put inflation surge firmly behind us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global economic environment is likely to continue to be challenging and less predictable that it was in the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK-US trade deal will leave effective tariff rate higher than where they started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK-US Trade Deal &apos;Good News&apos;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic impact of tariffs on UK depends a lot on what rest of the world agrees with the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are putting quite a bit of weight on forward-looking survey evidence showing easing wage inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the BoE cut the bank rate by 25 bps as expected yesterday with a &quot;more hawkish&quot; vote split as two members, including BoE&apos;s Mann, voted for no change. The market now sees a less dovish path for the central bank with 56 bps of easing priced in by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eurozone inflation depends on EU retaliation to the US.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geopolitics since the starts of the year is bad news for the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is downward pressure on inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need to watch for China goods rerouting to Europe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB June projections may be a little bit worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;June ECB cut is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no central scenario for ECB rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s unclear if a post-June cut will be in July or September.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are more or less there on inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite high chances we&apos;ll be undershooting on inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the US has made it clear that the 10% tariff rate is the floor, the ball is in EU&apos;s court. Will they take a more hawkish stance?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Taking all stake continues to be the starting point for negotiations with the US government&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We are presenting a range of proposals in talks with the US government&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;CFIUS expected to make a recommendation to US Steel deal to Trump by 21 May&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;A decision by Trump is expected by 5 June&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;At least now we have some key dates to attach to how things are playing out on this matter. As a reminder, Biden blocked the deal as one of his final acts as president. And in his most recent comments last month, Trump said that &quot;we don&apos;t want to see it go to Japan&quot;. So, there&apos;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
