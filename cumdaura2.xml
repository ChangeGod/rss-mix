                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EV sales down 39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hybrids up 29.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICE up 17.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting number because it shows that the race to beat the tariffs was real. That&apos;s going to create a bullwhip effect down the line and it shows a real effect on consumer behaviour. That&apos;s going to lead to a blockbuster April retail sales report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford shares are up 1% premarket, which puts them right back to where they were in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This was an interesting tease from Hassett on tariff deals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like the person in the middle of all that is Jamieson Greer and Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect this will be an announcement of a deal with India, where there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/a-good-bet-on-what-the-country-is-that-is-near-a-trade-deal-with-the-usa-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;mounting signs&lt;/a&gt; of a deal. The contours of that will be key, particularly if the US is will to lower its tariff floor below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it&apos;s safe to ignore this rise in claims.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The market appears to be coming around to the idea that the US economy is fine, or at least that it was fine before April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of upbeat commentary from Visa and the internals of yesterday&apos;s GDP report has the market thinking that the economy is on strong footing. The recent initial jobless claims numbers bear that out but that set will be tested again today. The consensus is 224K, up a touch from 222K a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then at 10 am ET, the focus will shift to the industrial economy with March construction spending and April ISM manufacturing. The latter is expected to slip to 48.0 from 49.0. Lately there has been a focus on the &apos;prices paid&apos; numbers as well but with oil prices cratering, the market is seeing more room for the Fed to cut rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude was last down $1.21 to $57.00.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US stocks have moved higher led by sharp gains in Meta and Microsoft after the close yesterday. That has the USDJPY moving higher with a bit of risk on and dovish comments from BOJ Ueda.  The EURUSD and GBPUSD have seen down and up price action today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN this video, I take a technical look at the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD from a technical perspective and outline the key levels in play and explain why.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware. Be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

That is leading to markets thinking about a further pause on rates in June next, following the decision today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY nudged higher from 144.20 to 144.75 during the presser and is still largely holding gains, seen up 1% at 144.50 levels now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, there wasn&apos;t too much action in the FX space. The dollar is keeping steadier across the board, but mostly little changed against the other major currencies. EUR/USD is lightly down by 0.1% to 1.1320 but was hovering around 1.1300 at the tail end of Asia trading. Meanwhile, GBP/USD is flat at 1.3325 and USD/CAD just up slightly by 0.2% to 1.3823 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, US futures are keeping higher after the late rebound from Wall Street yesterday. And the mood is helped by a jump up in tech shares after stronger earnings from Meta and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had US Treasury secretary Bessent out with some remarks as well but nothing that is too meaningful, mainly just a repeat of what we&apos;ve heard before. It&apos;s now more about walking the walk, not talking the talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The bond market is also continuing to hold the calm, so that&apos;s keeping the risk mood in a better spot to start the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the commodities space, gold is pushed down as it breaks away from its recent consolidation. The $3,200 level is now eyed next amid the break from the short-term technical range over the past week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Oil was a bit of a standout mover as it dipped down to a low of $56.40 as concerns continue to grow on multiple fronts on the oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We expect to see GDP revised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP decline may have been due to inventory stocking of imports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US households consumption is strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yields below Federal Funds Rate is signal that the Fed should cut rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our policies will bring down inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bolded comment is a classic &quot;rule of thumb&quot; in the markets. When the 2 year yield falls below the FFR, it&apos;s a signal that the market views the tightening cycle over and expects the Fed to cut rates soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that it&apos;s based on markets expectations and they can be wrong at times. We saw that in 2023 when the 2 year yield has been below the FFR for a long time but then went all the way back to match the FFR. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 105,441 job cuts last month is 63% higher compared to the same month last year. That brings the year-to-date total to 602,493 layoffs now, which is the highest since 2020. For some context, the figure is some 87% higher compared to the first four months of 2024. It once again underscores the impact of the DOGE layoffs, with 281,452 of those job cuts being directly attributed to that.&lt;/p&gt;

He&apos;s basically telling us that the markets and the economy are indeed important for them despite Trump saying that he doesn&apos;t care as long as he gets what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The near 3% drop today sees oil poised for a potential decline of over 10% this week with not much reprieve in sight. The previous low in April this year touched $55.15 before a bounce on the tariffs pause. But even then, it hardly resulted in a change in confidence in the oil market. In fact, as things went on one can argue that we&apos;re seeing the developments turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latest news from Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t add much encouragement whatsoever to an already struggling outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the global economic backdrop set to soften amid tariffs and demand conditions also hit hard by the US-China trade standoff, the fact that OPEC+ continues to push for output increases is just adding a heavy burden to oil prices in the current landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s a tough one to weed out and the only saving grace looks to be a turning point on the tariffs front. That will be a key spot to watch for oil, considering it is getting little help elsewhere - in particular from OPEC+ and its members.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The crude oil market experienced a rough month due to Trump&apos;s aggressive tariffs announcement on April 2 that made the market to expect lower demand on the slowdown in the global economy coupled with higher supply as OPEC+ planned to increase production by more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw a strong rebound though on April 9 as Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and the market expected more de-escalation and started to price out the global slowdown. The delay in reaching the trade deals and fresh positive supply news eventually weighed on the sentiment and prices rolled over once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, crude oil extended the selloff as we got the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; news &lt;/a&gt;that the Saudi officials have told allies that they can sustain a prolonged period of low prices in what sounded like a threat of a price war. The focus is clearly on supply right now, but a non-consensus trade opportunity could be in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ocean container bookings have seen a significant decline since the tariffs announcement with bookings from China to US being down 60%. If Trump eases tariffs, we could experience a covid-like bullwhip effect where all those cancelled orders get rebooked creating a huge surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectations for strong demand and a rebound in global growth will likely push prices higher and a rally to the 70.00 handle on WTI wouldn&apos;t be surprising. But being a contrarian is not enough because you have to get the timing right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Steinhardt, a trading legend, once said that ideally you should be able to tell, in two minutes, four things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the consensus view&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the variant perception&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the trigger event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trigger event, in my opinion, could be the details of the first trade deal. Markets will derive future expectations from that first deal. I think an average tariff rate of 10% or lower (the lower the better), would be the catalyst for a rally in crude oil prices. The idea would be invalidated in case we get a higher rate of course. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Former US Treasury Secretary Yellen: Trump tariffs to have &apos;tremendously adverse&apos; impact</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump tariffs to have &apos;tremendously adverse&apos; impact on the US economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They &apos;hobble&apos; companies that rely on critical minerals supplies from China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 40% of goods imported into the country were inputs for domestic production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odds for a recession have gone up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs could be particularly problematic for the US clean energy sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are highly dependent on China for most of the critical minerals that go into the clean energy technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a very consensus view that tariffs will likely have an adverse impact on the US economy and that the recession probabilities have gone up. The market priced that in soon after the April 2 announcement, but started to price out that view after Trump&apos;s pause on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now looking forward to positive resolutions that will eventually trigger the opposite effect: the US economy will bounce back and economic activity will rise. That&apos;s why trade talks and negotiations are critical. If they disappoint the market, then we will likely go back to price in the recession. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Many individuals and families across the United States face
financial hardship, often struggling to cover essential expenses such as rent,
utilities, childcare, and medical bills. Navigating the complex landscape of
financial assistance programs can be overwhelming, especially for those who are
unsure of where to start or what resources are available to them. This is where
HelpForAfricanAmericans, the largest directory of financial assistance programs
for African Americans, steps in to provide crucial support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HelpForAfricanAmericans operates an extensive database that
compiles information on financial aid opportunities for African Americans in
all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Through its website, users can access a
comprehensive list of programs offering support for various needs, including
help with groceries, rent, utility bills, college expenses, medical bills, and
more. The goal is to connect individuals with the resources that can provide
meaningful assistance during times of financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of the website’s mission is accessibility. By
centralizing information on available financial aid programs, the directory
eliminates much of the guesswork and frustration that often accompanies the
search for assistance. Instead of combing through multiple sources, individuals
can quickly find relevant programs in their state, making it easier to apply
for the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directory covers a wide range of financial aid topics,
ensuring that people can find assistance tailored to their specific
circumstances. Programs listed include grants for home and car repairs, food
assistance, legal aid, childcare support, and help with medical expenses. There
are also resources for those seeking debt consolidation, foreclosure
prevention, and college scholarships. Additionally, specialized programs cater
to individuals with disabilities, seniors, and those facing unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most popular topics among users include rent
assistance, cash aid for those in need, support for purchasing a car or
computer, and help with groceries. These high-demand programs reflect the
common financial challenges faced by many African Americans and highlight the
organization’s commitment to addressing pressing concerns within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual financial assistance, the directory also
provides information on broader government welfare programs and nonprofit
organizations dedicated to supporting African Americans. Users can explore
options such as Section 8 housing assistance, food stamps, and state-specific
grants designed to alleviate financial burdens. The inclusion of these
resources ensures that individuals have a comprehensive understanding of the
aid available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website’s approach is rooted in empowerment. Equipping
people with knowledge about financial assistance programs enables them to make
informed decisions about their financial well-being. The platform also serves
as an educational resource, helping individuals understand eligibility
requirements, application processes, and the scope of available aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a directory of financial
assistance programs, HelpForAfricanAmericans actively works to keep its
information up to date. The landscape of financial aid is constantly evolving,
with new programs being introduced and existing ones undergoing changes.
Maintaining accurate and current information ensures that users can rely on the
directory as a trusted resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking financial relief, finding the right
assistance program can make a significant difference. Whether it’s a grant for
college tuition, support for managing debt, or help covering medical expenses,
https://helpforafricanamericans.org/ simplifies the search process and connects
African Americans with the resources they need. With a commitment to
accessibility, accuracy, and comprehensive coverage, this financial assistance
directory plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between individuals in need
and the support systems designed to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About HelpforAfricanAmericans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Help for African Americans, the mission is to empower
and uplift the African American community by providing accessible resources,
vital information, and support for those in need. The platform works to bridge
gaps in healthcare, education, social justice, and economic opportunity by
fostering a nationwide network of information and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing PMI 45.4 vs 44.0 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 44.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New orders and employment all decrease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input cost inflation at 28-month high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Dobson, Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The start of the second quarter saw UK manufacturing
buffeted by adverse global market conditions, rising cost
pressures, deteriorating supply chains and increased
trade uncertainty. April saw further contractions in
output, new orders and exports, as well as a slump in
business confidence to its lowest ebb since November
2022.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although domestic demand remains soft, overseas
demand is especially weak. New export business fell
at the quickest pace for nearly five years, with demand
from clients in the US, Europe and mainland China all
declining. Surveyed manufacturers noted that US tariff
announcements were having a noticeable impact on
global markets as trading partners adapt to increased
trade volatility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturers are also seeing an increasingly harsh
cost environment, with purchase price inflation hitting
a 28-month high. Alongside general raw material price
increases on global markets, UK producers are also facing
domestic inflationary pressure from increases to National
Insurance, minimum wages and the knock-on impact of
the latter on higher pay grades. These increased costs
are resulting in a combination of higher selling prices
and cutbacks to non-essential spending on staffing
and purchasing, potentially reinforcing the &apos;rising costs,
declining demand&apos; backdrop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The stock market bottomed a week after the April 2 announcement when President Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9. That week we reached the peak in trade escalation and from that moment onwards, the risk/reward picture favoured the upside for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/this-is-the-key-line-from-chinas-retaliation-you-should-focus-on-20250411/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;de-escalation trend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The negative data continues to be faded because it&apos;s old news and the market is looking forward to positive resolutions and eventually higher economic activity as the trade uncertainty wanes. This trend is likely to remain intact until we get the details of the first trade deal. If the average tariff rate is 10% or lower, we should see the market continuing higher and eventually make new all-time highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a rate above 10% would likely be a disappointment and the market could go back pricing in slower growth with the stock market selling off again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke above the key resistance level and the major trendline. We got a retest of the broken resistance yesterday when the US GDP triggered some short-term weakness, but eventually we got back to the highs and even made new ones. The next target is the swing level around 5,800 price region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see the short-term selloff triggered by the US GDP that eventually bottomed around the key 5,480 level where the dip buyers piled in and got some support from good US Core PCE data. Later in the day, we also got the news that the US reached to China for tariff talks which supported further upside. And everything culminated with strong tech earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have the 5,596 level as the closest support where the buyers could step in with a defined risk below the level to position for further upside. In case of a break though, the sellers will likely push the price all the way back to the 5,520 level where we will find a minor upward trendline. That will be the next support for the dip-buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 96 bps (96% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 53 bps (55% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 118 bps (92% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 78 bps (75% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 33 bps (81% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 10 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/what-are-the-interest-rate-expectations-for-g8fx-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest moves in interest rate expectations happened with the Fed and the BoJ. The market increased the easing bets for the Fed following the weaker than expected US Q1 GDP yesterday. and decreased the tightening bets for the BoJ following the dovish policy decision and Governor Ueda&apos;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These expectations hinge on the trade deals though. If the details of the first trade deal show that the average tariff rate will be at or below 10%, then we can expect the market to reprice the expectations on a more hawkish side. Markets tend to overshoot expectations and that&apos;s what provides traders with mean reversion opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

USD/JPY currently trades at 144.57 on the day, up from around 144.20 prior to Ueda&apos;s presser.&lt;/p&gt;

Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold continues to correct
lower as the market unwinds some of the stagflationary risk that was priced in
in the past months. The de-escalation trend will likely remain intact until the
first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stagflationary pricing is
what got gold to such high prices, and as we start to price out that risk, it’s
normal to see a correction, especially considering that “long gold” has been
the most crowded trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture, gold
remains in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid Fed
easing. But in the short-term more positive news on the tariffs front should see
more downside for gold as the market readjusts to new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that gold broke out of the recent range to the downside as the market
continues to reprice the stagflationary risks. From a risk management
perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the previous
high at 3167 to position for further upside, while the sellers will look for a
break lower to increase the bearish bets into the major trendline around the
3100 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see more clearly the breakout of the range between the 3258 support and the
3367 resistance. We now have a downward trendline defining the bearish
momentum. The sellers will likely step in around the broken support and the
trendline to position for further downside, while the buyers will want to see
the price breaking higher to target the 3367 level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart,
there’s not much else we can add here as the sellers will likely step in both
at the broken support and the trendline, while the buyers will pile in at every
break higher. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
