                            &lt;p&gt;What happened to the Tea Party?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal conservatism continues to die a slow death in the United States and the bond market may be taking notice. The latest Congressional estimates from the  Joint Committee on Taxation show a $3.8 trillion increase in the deficit over 10 years, or about 14% of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put differently, this would add about $11,000 in debt for every American and for FY 2026, it would add $481 billion to the deficit, about 1.5 pp of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding &apos;no tax on tips&apos; and &apos;no tax on overtime&apos; until 2029. Now these estimates are just on the revenue side (though not all of it) so there are some spending cuts to come but so far Republicans are struggling to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the bond market, we&apos;re getting perilously close to 5% for 30-year yields.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;142&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is pushing higher again and now approaches a key resistance area between 1.1193 and 1.1213 — a zone that has capped rallies multiple times in the past, including three peaks in July and August 2024. The high price has reached 1.11823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;641&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding weight to the topside test is the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, currently sitting near 1.1209, right in the heart of the resistance zone. The 100-hour moving average is also in play and in that area at 1.12101 (not shown on the chart above). A clean break above this cluster would strengthen the bullish case and open the door for further upside momentum.  Conversely it could also be a level where sellers may look to lean with a stop on a break above. As such it is important for both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;643&quot; data-end=&quot;1045&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the closest support comes in at 1.11452, which previously acted as a swing high in early April and is now a short-term line in the sand for buyers. Holding above it keeps the bullish structure intact. A break below would shift the focus back toward the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally at 1.10395, and further to the 1.1000 natural support level. Yesterday the low price after the fall on the China US tariff news reached 1.1065 – well short of that 38.2% retracement target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1143&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.1193–1.1213 (swing zone), 1.1209 (200-bar MA), 1.1210 (100 hour moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1146&quot; data-end=&quot;1248&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.11452 (near-term swing), 1.1065 (low from yesterday, 1.10395 (38.2% retracement of move up from the January 2025 low), 1.1000 (natural support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1251&quot; data-end=&quot;1322&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Buyers make a play but work to do. Modest bullish bias while above 1.11452; but stronger upside if 1.1213 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;108&quot; data-end=&quot;431&quot;&gt;Bank of America has lowered its USD/CAD year-end forecast from 1.40 to 1.38, citing overly optimistic CAD pricing in April. While the pair may consolidate near 1.40 in the near term, BofA sees medium-term downside to 1.35 and recommends a 1-year RKO (reverse knock-out) put to express that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;433&quot; data-end=&quot;448&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;450&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;452&quot; data-end=&quot;593&quot;&gt;Revised Forecast: USD/CAD is now expected to end 2025 at 1.38 (previously 1.40), with potential to reach 1.35 in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;597&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;599&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot;&gt;Drivers of CAD Strength: April’s rally was fueled by a BoC rate cut pause, expectations for fiscal expansion, and anticipated investment inflows—factors BofA believes may have driven temporary CAD overvaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;962&quot;&gt;Near-Term Outlook: BofA sees USD/CAD trading sideways around 1.40 over the next two quarters before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;964&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;966&quot; data-end=&quot;1103&quot;&gt;Trade Strategy: A 1-year RKO put is favored to cheaply express a bearish view while taking advantage of current skew pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1105&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1107&quot; data-end=&quot;1250&quot;&gt;Macro Risk: The main risk is a North American recession in 2025, which would trigger renewed USD strength and invalidate the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1252&quot; data-end=&quot;1543&quot;&gt;BofA remains moderately bearish USD/CAD into 2025, targeting 1.35 medium-term, but sees near-term consolidation. Their preferred expression is a cost-efficient options strategy, allowing participation in a slow USD decline without overexposing to short-term volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For bank trade ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747245752546000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw072cueov7Da1Dl2iizFl2o&quot;&gt;check out eFX Plus&lt;/a&gt;.

America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a
 beautiful thing!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market pricing is for 51 bps in easing this year, starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s no surprise the Treasury is announcing new sanctions with Trump talking about Iran and visiting the Middle East. The latest sanctions target the global network shipping Iranian oil, the Treasuy wrote in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude oil is up $1.79 to $63.74 today. The S&amp;amp;P 500 just crossed +1%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is trading to new site session highs as Pres. Trump completes his speech in Saudi Arabia. Toward the end of his speech he did say that he will order the cessation of sanctions against Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASDAQ index is now up 316 points or 1.69% at 19024.53. The high price came in at 19024.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday recall, the price extended above its 100-day moving average currently at 18466.65. That was the first break - and close - above  that moving average since February 24. The price also moved above a swing low from January 13 at 18831.91. Both of those levels will now be close support. Staying above is more bullish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyers are taking back more control. The next target comes against the high price from February 27 at 19286.02. Above that and were in the upper extreme which peaked at 20204.58 on December 16. That was the all-time high for the index.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The GBPUSD is continuing to push higher, breaking above its 100-hour moving average (blue line on the chart above) and swing level which are both at 1.3257. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum to the upside has continued to the 200-hour moving average at 1.32837. That moving average was tested on Friday&apos;s trade, but found willing sellers after a failed break above fizzled quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move above the 200-hour moving average would give the buyers more control with a high price from Friday&apos;s trade at 1.3223 the next target.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;One of the early lessons of Trump&apos;s second term is that when he says to buy stocks, the market goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s being less explicit this time and didn&apos;t write it on Truth Social so I&apos;d be cautious. Previously, he tweeted it before announcing good news like removing reciprocal tariffs and the China deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 0.8% and hasn&apos;t reacted since his comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of his other comments are on geopolitics like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest destructive force in the middle east is Iran&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;404&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD has turned higher in trading today and tests the 200-day moving average, each of which failed to generate sustained upside momentum on 2 previous tests yesterday and last Thursday (despite ticks above the MA). The last two attempts above the level were particularly weak, leading to a sharper corrective move lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the pair moved lower helped by the dollar buying after the US/China tariff news, Today, the pair has reversed the declines.  The Asian and early European session saw the pair move up to test the 100 hour and the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart  (see blue lines on the chart above).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That run got another boost by the CPI data. That helped to extend above the MAs and the 200 hour MA at 0.64307.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is now testing the 200 day MA at 0.64579 (and moving higher). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;406&quot; data-end=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Can the buyers keep the momentum going?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;937&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That will be the key for today/now.  On the topside, any rebound would need to reclaim the old highs last week including the high from May 5 at 0.6493&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;151&quot; data-end=&quot;320&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD extended higher yesterday and again earlier today, but both rallies have stalled just ahead of a key resistance confluence. The area of interest includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;381&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day moving average, currently near 1.40111&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;382&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;384&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The swing area resistance between 1.4009 and 1.4027&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;440&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;442&quot; data-end=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s high stopped at 1.40157 before rotating back lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;506&quot; data-end=&quot;837&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This zone has now rejected buyers on two separate occasions, reinforcing its role as a critical barrier that bulls must break to extend the upside bias. A clean move above 1.4027 would open the door toward the 38.2%% retracement of the move down from the March high at 1.40525, with other key resistance around the 50% and swing area between 1.4146–1.41836.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;839&quot; data-end=&quot;1193&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the initial support now comes in near 1.3978, where the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart lines up with the old swing high from April 15. Holding above that level keeps the rebound and short term bullish bias intact. A move below it, however, could trigger a deeper correction down to 1.389172 1.3904 swing area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1200&quot; data-end=&quot;1225&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1228&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.4009–1.4027 (200-day MA + swing), 1.40525 (38.2% retracement), 1.4146 to 1.41836 (50% and swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1303&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1389&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3978 (4H 200-bar MA/old high from April 15), 1.38917 – 1.3904 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1390&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1392&quot; data-end=&quot;1474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral to bullish above 1.3978; stronger bullish bias only above 1.4027 and then the 38.2% retracement at 1.40525&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Details of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney&apos;s cabinet are leaking out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Francois-Philippe Champagne to be finance minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Hodgson named minister of energy and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dominic Leblanc remains in charge of US-Canada trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrystia Freeland remains minister for transport and internal trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Melanie Joly  named industry minister&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sean Fraser, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maninder Sidhu, Minister of International Trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evan Solomon, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are mostly familiar faces. Champagne and Leblanc travelled to Washington in March at the peak of tariff anxiety and seemed to get along with Lutnick and others at the White House so that may be a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical name will be Tim Hodgson who worked with Carney at Goldman Sachs and was CEO of Goldman Sachs Canada. He was also the Chair of Hydro One. He was recruited by Carney to run and will have a big job in developing Canadian energy and pipelines while navigating/rewriting brutal regulations. It&apos;s a strong signal that he means business on development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also notable that Carney named a minister of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market is exhibiting diverse patterns today, with notable sector-specific performance highlighting varying investor outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology Storms Ahead: The technology sector is experiencing substantial growth. Nvidia (NVDA) is a major highlight, surging by 5.00%, driven by robust performance expectations and increased demand for AI technologies. Oracle (ORCL) and Palantir (PLTR) also see significant gains, up 2.13% and 4.33%, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical Resilience: The consumer cyclical arena is buoyant, with Amazon (AMZN) climbing 2.81%. Tesla (TSLA) also rejoices with a rise of 1.24%, reflecting positive market sentiment towards these retail and automotive giants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Sector Under Pressure: Conversely, the healthcare sector suffers, with UnitedHealth (UNH) nosediving 14.80%, dragging down overall sentiment. Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) also face declines of 0.43% and 3.73%, respectively, possibly due to unfavorable earnings reports or regulatory challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Services Ascend: The sector, guided by Google (GOOG) up 1.00%, showcases a robust outlook, supported by positive investor confidence in digital advertising prospects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s trading landscape paints a picture of mixed sentiment. Investors are clearly favoring tech and consumer cyclical stocks, likely due to optimism surrounding emerging technologies and consumer spending potential. However, the pronounced downturn in the healthcare sector suggests caution, perhaps due to policy discussions or earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering today’s performance, investors are encouraged to monitor the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capitalize on Technology: Given the upbeat trajectory in tech, maintaining or increasing exposure to key players like Nvidia and Oracle could capitalize on ongoing trends. Pay close attention to innovations and earnings announcements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review Healthcare Holdings: With current uncertainties, reconsideration of holdings in the healthcare sector is advisable. Keep an eye on regulatory changes and future earnings guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification Remains Key: Well-balanced portfolios across resilient sectors, including communication services and stable consumer cyclical stocks, can mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay informed with real-time updates and comprehensive analyses at ForexLive.com to adeptly navigate the market&apos;s evolving dynamics. 📈&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;159&quot; data-end=&quot;398&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF moved higher yesterday on the back of broad USD strength, but momentum stalled before reaching the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.84823. The high price reached 0.8475.  That retracement level remains a critical hurdle for any sustained recovery.  Absent that, and the correction higher is just a plain-vanilla variety and keeps the sellers in play.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;400&quot; data-end=&quot;686&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, price action has rotated lower but found support at a well-defined swing area between 0.8368 and 0.84087 — a zone that has served as a floor going back to August 2024. Buyers stepped in as the pair tested the lower end of that support band during the European/early US session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also helping to reinforce the support is the falling 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near the swing low. That technical confluence is attracting dip buyers, at least for now. The current price is above the swing area high at 0.84087.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;688&quot; data-end=&quot;899&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support holding on the dip has set the stage for the battle between the buyers down to 0.8369 and the sellers up to 0.84823.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;901&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In summary, bulls will need to see a break above 0.84823 (38.2% retracement) to tilt the bias more favorably to the upside. On the downside, a break back below 0.8368 would open the door toward deeper targets and shift the bias firmly back to bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1192&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1193&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1195&quot; data-end=&quot;1284&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8368–0.84087 (swing area), 0.8318 to 0.8340 (swing area), 0.82723 (low from late April)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1285&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1366&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.84823 (38.2% retrace), 0.85309 to 0.85573 (swing), 0.86193 (50% retrace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1367&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1446&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral above 0.8368; bullish above 0.84823; bearish below 0.8368&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Fear has been replaced by FOMO in markets. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are now up 40 points and getting to within striking distance of 6000, which we haven&apos;t been above since March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market continues to digest the US-China trade war climb down and it likes what it&apos;s hearing. We are expecting comments from Trump shortly so that could be a source of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zooming out to the daily chart, there isn&apos;t much standing in the way of a return to the February all-time highs now.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;China has announced the things that were pledged on Sunday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To adjust tariff rates on US goods on May 14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To pause the 24% tariff rate on US goods for 90 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sets tariff rate at 10%, as expected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;says reduction in tariffs meets expectations of producers and consumers in both countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To cancel additional tariffs imposed on US products under two later rounds of measures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure on the significance of this but I think it&apos;s highlighting that they need to see further progress. US stocks have been bid since the open, reversing earlier selling in the futures market. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;54&quot; data-end=&quot;531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday the GBPUSD tumbled lower on the back of the China/US tariff fall and suspension, and in the process sliced through the familiar swing zone at 1.32598 (see green numbered circles) and the lower band between 1.3232‑1.3241 (see red numbered circles), then briefly pierced the 38.2 % retrace of the April rally at 1.31603, printing a session low of 1.3139.  Momentum dried up quickly; the pair rebounded back above the retracement and used it as a launchpad in late US trading and early Asian-Pacific trading today.  The low price today held at 1.31639, keeping that Fibonacci level intact as risk‑defining support.  Remember that level going forward on any reversal back to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;533&quot; data-end=&quot;974&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound helped by the lower CPI today in the US has carried price back into the congestion corridor .  The first layer of topside work sits at the old swing floor turned ceiling between 1.3232 and 1.3241, followed by the swing level and 100‑hour moving average which both come in at 1.32598.  A decisive break above that 100‑hour MA would open the door toward the 200‑hour MA at 1.32845. A break above would re‑energise the upside once again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;976&quot; data-end=&quot;1312&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Failing to clear the 100 and 200 hour moving averages would keep the sellers in play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1319&quot; data-end=&quot;1357&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels (one‑liners):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1359&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1359&quot; data-end=&quot;1412&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1361&quot; data-end=&quot;1412&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Short term bias defining level intraday: 1.32320‑1.32410 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1413&quot; data-end=&quot;1456&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1415&quot; data-end=&quot;1456&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance 1: 1.32598 (100‑hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1457&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance 2: ≈1.3284 (200‑hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1457&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1459&quot; data-end=&quot;1522&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 1: 1.3201 to 1.32067 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1567&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1569&quot; data-end=&quot;1611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 2: 1.3160 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1612&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1614&quot; data-end=&quot;1651&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support 3: 1.3139 (low from yesterday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;104&quot; data-end=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s announcement of a 90‑day suspension of some US‑China tariffs lit a fire under USDJPY, propelling the pair from a gap higher low 145.71, to a session peak at 148.64.
That rally stopped cold in a long‑standing swing zone between 148.56 and 148.73 (red arrows on the chart) — the same band that capped price action multiple times in February–March and going back to December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;465&quot; data-end=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the mood has shifted. A lower‑than‑expected US CPI print clipped US yields and the dollar, knocking USDJPY back lower.  Despite the setback, buyers still hold the near‑term edge while price remains above the first support target:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;722&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;722&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;724&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;147.20‑147.34 swing area dating to August 2024 (not shown)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;777&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;779&quot; data-end=&quot;828&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;38.2 % retrace of the April rebound at 147.14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;830&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hold above that risk‑defining zone and the upside bias survives; break below and the recovery narrative starts to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;958&quot; data-end=&quot;1089&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, the market must clear yesterday’s 148.73 high to reignite momentum.

      <title>Mark Carney to unveil cabinet today</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will unveil is cabinet today in a move that could move the Canadian dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market still isn&apos;t sure how Carney will govern and his plan to &apos;build, baby, build&apos; and counter US tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/sets-the-tone-more-than-half-of-pm-carneys-new-cabinet-will-be-fresh-faces/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reporting &lt;/a&gt;said former Finance Minister and Trump-antagonist Chrystia Freeland would be left off the roster but that was quickly reversed and denied. It appears she will get a role and that&apos;s not a big surprise given that Carney is the godfather of her son and they&apos;ve long been close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney is looking to build national bridges though and she&apos;s carrying much of Trudeau&apos;s baggage. It would be a poor sign if she had a high profile position like Finance Minister. I suspect that will go to former Laurentian Bank economist Carlos Leitao, who was previously Quebec&apos;s Minister of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another portfolio to watch is Environment. That portfolio has been a major drag on Canadian construction and investment. Eco-warrior Steven Guilbeault will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsnews.com/the-mix/steven-guilbeault-to-remain-in-cabinet-source-10648622&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reportedly &lt;/a&gt;remain in cabinet but if it&apos;s in the environment file, it won&apos;t bode well for the loonie but early indications are that it&apos;s the Heritage file, which is also responsible for biodiversity, nature and Parks Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney is expected to name 30 cabinet ministers overall but early reporting indicates it will be many of the same faces from the Trudeau regime, with about half being new cabinet ministers along with a roster of 10 &apos;secretaries of state&apos; who will have portfolios but won&apos;t participate in most cabinet meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this, the market will be watching for the opening of parliament on May 27 and the throne speech.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;158&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD is seeing a modest rebound today after sharp declines yesterday, driven in part by a stronger USD following news of US-China tariff reductions (set for a 90-day period at least). The move lower on Monday found buyers just ahead of the 38.2% retracement of the January–April rally at 1.10395 — a level that remains a critical support line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;512&quot; data-end=&quot;636&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break below that 38.2% level would signal a deeper corrective move is underway, shifting the bias further to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;512&quot; data-end=&quot;636&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair is moving higher helped by the CPI data which was more modest than expectations (0.2% vs 0.3% for the headline and the core measures).  There has been a modest move higher with the pair trading to a new high at 1.11349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;638&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside technically, the pair now eyes the April 3 swing high at 1.11452. A sustained move above this level would tilt the bias more bullish and target the next resistance zone, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;831&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;831&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;833&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-bar MA (4H) currently near 1.1200&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;883&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A swing area up to 1.1213&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;916&quot; data-end=&quot;1098&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the bounce is corrective, but traders will be watching whether the pair can push through key resistance or fall back toward the retracement level to confirm trend direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1105&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1180&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1180&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.10395 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1181&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1183&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.11452 (Apr 3 swing), 1.1200–1.1213 (MA/swing zone and the 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1254&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1256&quot; data-end=&quot;1329&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral near-term; bearish below 1.10395, more bullish above 1.11452&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crypto mixing with DC politics? For the
longest time, that combination often spelled trouble—think friction, regulatory
fog, and sometimes, downright opposition from the powers that be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ground seems to be shifting
rapidly in 2025. The once-chilly regulatory environment is showing signs of a
thaw, spurred by a new administration&apos;s different tune and a crypto industry
ready to make its voice heard loud and clear inside the Beltway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t just quiet diplomacy; it&apos;s an
all-out push. Cryptocurrency advocates are flooding Washington, armed with
arguments, funding, and a sense of urgency. They see a window of opportunity
opening, especially with predictions floating around—even from major industry
players—that meaningful, pro-crypto regulations could start taking shape,
perhaps as soon as this August. It&apos;s a high-stakes moment, potentially setting
the stage for how digital assets integrate into the world&apos;s largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binance CEO:
Pro-Crypto Regulations Could Come to the US by August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent voices adding
fuel to the August expectation fire is Binance CEO Richard Teng. Speaking
recently, Teng suggested the US&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2025/04/30/binance-crypto-us-money/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; could see new, supportive crypto legislation&lt;/a&gt;
emerge by late summer. Teng explained his optimistic view under the Trump
administration, “The new efforts and optimism is very real in the US. So, I
believe the US is going to come out with very enlightened, pro-industry and
smart regulations that support the industry but also manages the risk at the
same time. So you’re probably going to see some of the new legislation coming
through by August this year.” This positive view is contrasted starkly with
what many in the industry perceived as the &quot;Operation Choke Point 2.0&quot;
environment of the previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teng sees the shift in the US potentiallyacting as a catalyst globally. As he noted at
the CONVERGE LIVE conference, when the world&apos;s biggest economy signals it wants
to embrace crypto, it prompts other governments to seriously consider their own
approaches. This perspective comes even as the administration&apos;saggressive
tariff policies introduced earlier in the year initially sent shockwaves
through global markets, including the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights a
potentially complex dynamic where trade protectionism coexists with a more
favorable stance on digital asset innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binance itself is navigating this market
from a position of strength, bolstered by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/mgx-backs-binance-in-landmark-investment-6242106085221073480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;landmark $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi&apos;s MGX&lt;/a&gt;—the
largest single investment into a crypto firm, paid entirely in stablecoins.
Furthermore, Teng has confirmed Binance isadvising
multiple governments and sovereign wealth funds on building their own national
digital asset reserves and regulatory frameworks, underlining the increasing
global trend towards state-level crypto engagement influenced partly by US
moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crypto
Lobbyists Are Flooding the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Teng&apos;s optimism isn&apos;t happening
in a vacuum; it&apos;s backed by an unprecedented level of activity from crypto
proponents on the ground in Washington. The industry isn&apos;t just knocking on
doors; it&apos;s practically setting up shop. We&apos;re talking aboutmore
than a dozen distinct groups—from established players like the Digital Chamber
of Commerce, the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation
(CCI) to newer, more focused entities like the Solana Policy Institute and the
National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surge reflects a feeling that now is
the time to influence policy. As Miller Whitehouse-Levine, now leading the
Solana Policy Institute, put it, there&apos;s an &quot;absolute torrent&quot; of
legislative and regulatory work happening, and the industry needs &quot;all the
help we could get.&quot; There&apos;s certainly plenty to tackle, with Congress
debating everything from market structure and stablecoin oversight to illicit
finance concerns and even government digital asset reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, having so many players can
lead to challenges. Insiders privately admit the field is getting crowded,
potentially leading to duplicated efforts or diluted messages when engaging
with the finite number of key congressional staff and administration officials.
Funding and membership can also become competitive points. Still, the
prevailing view seems to be that a united front, even across multiple
organizations, is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent wins, like the bipartisan pushback
against a potentially cripplingIRS
rule targeting DeFi, show that coordinated advocacy can yield results. On top
of the traditional lobbying, well-funded political action committees like
Fairshake and grassroots efforts like Coinbase&apos;s Stand With Crypto are flexing
their political muscle, aiming to ensure Congress remains crypto-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next On the
Table: A US Stablecoin Bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what&apos;s the most immediate focus of
all this activity? Eyes are firmly fixed on stablecoin regulation. These
digital dollars are seen as a critical bridge between traditional finance and
the crypto world, and getting the rules right is a top priority. Two bills, in
particular, are front and center: theSTABLE
Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these two bills are really trying to
do is build a rulebook for stablecoins across the US. They get into the
nitty-gritty—like which companies can actually create stablecoins, demanding
they hold reliable reserves (think cash or safe government bonds), and setting
up oversight. The fact that both pieces of legislation actuallymade
it through their House and Senate committees this spring, and with lawmakers
from both parties agreeing, was a pretty big step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact timing, the
momentum behind stablecoin legislation is undeniable. The GENIUS Act&apos;s proposed
dual-oversight structure—letting smaller issuers stick with state regulators
while larger ones fall under federal watch—seems designed to balance innovation
with stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a minute there, the buzz was that
Senate Majority Leader John Thunemight
push for a full Senate vote on the GENIUS Act before Memorial Day. That talk
has quieted down a bit, making the exact timing fuzzy now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, getting any stablecoin bill signed
into law would be huge for the cryptocurrency industry. It would signal that
the US is finally getting serious about fitting digital assets into the
financial picture and could be the first domino to fall, leading to clearer
rules for other parts of crypto later on.&lt;/p&gt;

The food index fell 0.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core CPI was 2.1% annualized over the three months through April and 3.0% annualized in the six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Fed would have an easy time teeing up a cut right now if not for the tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget housing and insurance, we&apos;re onto tariff effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goldman Sachs now expects the ECB to reach terminal rate at 1.75% in July</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has shifted closer to market pricing on the ECB. They now see a 25 bps cut in June and another July, which would get them to 1.75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is still skeptical on that timeline, seeing only an 80% chance of a cut in June and a lower likelihood of a cut at the July 24 meeting. The big event to watch for is July 9, which is the expiration of the reciprocal tariff exemption. So far progress on EU-US talks has been very slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also raised its GDP forecast for the Eurozone following the US-China deal and now sees +0.1% in Q3 and Q4 vs no growth prior. That&apos;s hardly inspiring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
