                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There is just one to take note of on the board for today, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That being for EUR/USD at the 1.1325 level. The expiries match up with the 100-hour moving average, which alongside the 200-hour moving average at 1.1347 might help to keep a lid on price action in the session ahead. The dollar is in a calmer mood after having falling slightly yesterday before a bit of a recovery late on and earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The price action to start the week is not indicative of much, as traders continue to wait on trade developments for the most part. There&apos;s also the prospect of the Fed coming up later in the week. And by that, I mean Trump&apos;s reaction to when the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects USD/CNY to decline further, citing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;growing optimism around U.S.-China trade talks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;shift from short to long CNY positions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move lower could be swift and event-driven in the near term, while the PBOC may guide a more gradual adjustment over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China will welcome back yuan strength. &lt;/p&gt;

It
was a volatile day for Asian currencies, with some losses against the
USD. The Taiwan dollar retraced a little after its epic surge higher
on Friday and Monday. Comments from Central Bank Governor Yang
Chin-Long sought to calm markets and have had some success. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Hong
Kong’s central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, intervened to
sell HKD at the top end of its band. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;USD/JPY
rose from early lows under 143.60 to above 144.25 before giving almost
all back. Its circa 143.80 as I update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
pattern of movement was similar across much of major FX. EUR, GBP,
AUD, NZD, CAD all lost ground in early Asia trade against the US
dollar but have retraced those losses. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There
were a few items of interest for US equities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump says he&apos;ll announce pharmaceutical tariffs over the next two weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a
U.S. lawmaker will be introducing legislation in coming weeks to
verify the location of artificial-intelligence chips like those made
by Nvidia (NVDA) after they are sold, aiming to  address reports of
widespread smuggling of  chips into China in violation of U.S. export
control laws&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
U.S. Justice Department has asked a judge to require Google to sell
two of its businesses that help websites buy, sell and serve online
advertising after a judge found the company illegally monopolized
those markets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
stock futures fell,
S&amp;amp;P 500 e-minis down 0.3%, Nasdaq futures down 0.56% as
I update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;On
the data front:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China
Caixin Services PMI for April 2025 remained in expansion at 50.7, but
at its slowest since September 2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chinese
markets reopened after holidays on Thursday, Friday and Monday. The
People’s Bank of China set the reference rate at it strongest (for
CNY) since April 7. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australian
building permits and household spending, both for March, were weak.
Household Spending was its slowest in 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;As
a heads up, Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Carney will meet at 11.45
am US Eastern time on Tuesday. US Commerce Secretary Lutnick said that
while a trade deal with Canada is possible, its really complex. Keep
your expectations low seems to be the (not very quiet) subtext of
this. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent oil rose a little after its four year low yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/TWD&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Taiwan dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar after Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-Long sought to calm markets following a sharp two-day rally in the local currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang urged restraint from market commentators and warned manufacturers not to be swayed by exaggerated or misleading exchange rate analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DBS strategist Philip Wee, the currency’s pullback reflects official efforts to rein in speculation. These include the central bank’s confirmation that it had intervened to counter what it viewed as overly aggressive expectations for Taiwan dollar appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWD update, not a big retracement!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted on the TWD surge:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/mufg-on-the-taiwan-dollar-move-a-19-standard-deviation-event-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link article-link&quot;&gt;MUFG on the Taiwan dollar move a &quot;19-standard-deviation event&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/surging-twd-fuelling-revaluation-talk-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link article-link&quot;&gt;Surging TWD fuelling revaluation talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The surge in tariffs and disruption to global supply chains are delivering a heavy blow to the city’s re-export-driven economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;1053&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
•  41% of Hong Kong’s container shipments to North America cancelled for the week of May 12.
•  Data from Freightos and Sea-Intelligence point to widespread sailing cancellations, reflecting escalating trade tensions.
•  Soaring tariffs—145% from the U.S. and 125% in Chinese retaliation—are choking cross-Pacific trade volumes.
•  Hong Kong’s role as a re-export hub makes it especially exposed to shocks in global trade flows.
•  Analysts warn tariffs above 35% wipe out margins, rendering many export routes economically unviable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;1053&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Info via Reuters &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Timiraos argues that the chaotic implementation of President Trump’s tariff policy is creating a difficult dilemma for the Federal Reserve: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;either risk a recession or grapple with stagflation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This policy bind will be a central focus at the Fed’s upcoming two-day meeting, where officials are expected to maintain their cautious stance on interest rate cuts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are set to reiterate their wait-and-see approach, underscoring their reluctance to ease policy too soon and risk undermining progress on inflation. As Powell put it last month, “We’ll make what will no doubt be a very difficult judgment.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
The situation has been likened to a goalkeeper’s dilemma—either stand firm to contain inflation or move quickly to support a weakening economy. But the Fed remains wary of acting pre-emptively, especially with tariffs threatening to raise short-term inflation through supply disruptions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“This is not going to be a cycle where the Fed pre-emptively cuts because there’s a forecast of a slowdown,” said former Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, now at Pimco. “They’re going to actually need to see it in the tangible data, in particular the labor market.”  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article is much longer and in depth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-meeting-interest-rates-powell-trump-bd21e33f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;if you can access it the link is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FOMC statement is due at 1800 GMT on Wednesday, May 7, 2025 91400 US Eastern time)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Powell speaks a half hour later&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Oh, here we go - at the Macquarie Australia conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ps.

The bank’s FX strategy team expects the pair to stabilise around 0.65 through mid-year, before gradually rising toward 0.67 by December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;428&quot; data-end=&quot;890&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NAB highlighted the shifting interest rate differential between Australia and the United States as a key driver of the currency pair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;428&quot; data-end=&quot;890&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NAB expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates by 50 basis points at the May meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;followed by additional 25bp cuts in July, August, November, and February&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;1042&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the path higher for the AUD may be gradual, NAB believes broad USD softness and stabilising risk sentiment will provide tailwinds into year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Mentions of “recession” on S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings calls have surged to their highest level since 2023, according to company transcripts tracked by analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spike in recession rhetoric comes despite generally solid earnings and resilient consumer data, highlighting mounting corporate unease over the broader macro backdrop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Executives are increasingly citing risks tied to inflation, higher-for-longer interest rates, and a potential slowdown in global demand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Notably, the re-emergence of U.S. tariff threats—particularly targeting China and key trade partners—has added another layer of uncertainty, raising concerns about supply chain disruptions and margin pressures. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysts say the cautious tone may reflect pre-emptive positioning ahead of a potentially more volatile second half. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cartoon was in Chinese media a month or so ago. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US equities - Retail investors pile in, but can retail alone ignite a bull market?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Retail investors poured a record $40 billion into equities in April, according to JP Morgan, marking the largest monthly inflow on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The surge underscores a renewed wave of optimism among individual traders, even as institutional investors tread cautiously amid macroeconomic uncertainties and volatile rate expectations. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysts say the buying spree was concentrated in technology and momentum names, with retail flows helping to cushion broader market dips. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JP Morgan noted the trend reflects growing retail resilience and a willingness to buy the dip, despite persistent concerns over inflation, geopolitics, and central bank policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know about anyone else but I&apos;ve seen this info kicking around, and approved of by folks who normally dismiss retail trader activity as dumb money and what have you. Political motivations, though, you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being a retail trader myself I am not confident that a surge in retail buying is a solid base upon which to build a renewed bull market. The absence of institutional interest is red flag for me. &lt;/p&gt;

$3,700 an ounce by year-end 2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; but in
the event of a recession, the acceleration in ETF inflows could drive
the gold price to $3,880&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GS say in the case of extreme risk scenarios - such as heightened concerns over Federal
Reserve independence or shifts in U.S. reserve policy - gold could
plausibly reach $4,500 by the end of 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; $4,000 by mid-2026.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong central bank intervention &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HKMA sells HK$ 60.543 bln into market as Hong Kong dollar hits strong end of trading range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1983, the HKD has been pegged to the U.S. dollar under a Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), ensuring exchange rate stability and promoting investor confidence. The peg ties the HKD at approximately 7.80 per U.S. dollar, with a permitted trading range of 7.75 to 7.85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HKMA uses an automatic adjustment mechanism to keep the HKD within its allowed band:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currency Board System: The HKMA operates a currency board arrangement, ensuring every HKD issued is backed by U.S. dollar reserves at a fixed rate. This means changes in the monetary base (the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves) are directly tied to foreign exchange inflows or outflows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention Mechanism:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the HKD approaches the strong side of 7.75, the HKMA sells HKD and buys U.S. dollars, injecting liquidity into the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the HKD nears the weak side of 7.85, the HKMA does the reverse—buying HKD and selling U.S. dollars, withdrawing liquidity.This ensures exchange rate stability within the target band.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted last week on Goldman Sachs mentioning that Asian FX would appreciate vs. the USD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/its-not-just-gold-goldman-sachs-says-asian-currencies-to-benefit-from-usd-losing-status-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Its not just gold - Goldman Sachs says Asian currencies to benefit from USD losing status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday the Taiwan dollar had an impossible move, a 19 standard deviation move higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/mufg-on-the-taiwan-dollar-move-a-19-standard-deviation-event-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;MUFG on the Taiwan dollar move a &quot;19-standard-deviation event&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/surging-twd-fuelling-revaluation-talk-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;Surging TWD fuelling revaluation talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not just TWD appreciating. &lt;/p&gt;
