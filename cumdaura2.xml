                            &lt;p&gt;Big Tech Earnings: Separating Headlines from Reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When big tech giants like this week&apos;s Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta report earnings, headlines quickly flood the market. These headlines often shape immediate investor sentiment and trading behavior. However, insightful investors understand a crucial truth: Headlines can mislead, and the actual price action provides the ultimate reality check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Real Market Response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s recent earnings serve as a prime example. Despite seemingly solid financial results—5% revenue growth and 12% increase in service revenues—Apple&apos;s stock fell approximately 3% pre-market. Why the disconnect? Investor uncertainty about future quarters and tariff impacts overshadowed strong headline figures. This illustrates why investors must go beyond superficial earnings narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines vs. Price Action: The Case of Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Microsoft&apos;s earnings headlines matched the positive price action, as shares surged nearly 8% following strong revenue gains attributed directly to strategic AI investments. The sustained positive price movement validated investors&apos; optimistic interpretation of Microsoft&apos;s headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Investors Should Prioritize Price Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Sentiment: Price action captures market sentiment comprehensively, reflecting collective investor judgment, including hidden risks or optimistic insights not immediately apparent in headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Validation: Sustained positive or negative price movement after earnings announcements often accurately predicts long-term performance better than short-lived headline-driven volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should adopt a disciplined approach, watching stock performance closely for several days post-earnings rather than reacting impulsively to initial headlines. Stocks maintaining strong positive momentum (like Microsoft and Meta currently exhibit) signal genuine market confidence. Conversely, sustained weakness (as observed recently in Apple and Amazon) indicates deeper investor skepticism or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, wise investors will leverage headlines as initial signals, validating these signals through careful monitoring of subsequent price action. This strategy helps distinguish genuine investment opportunities from transient market noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

      <title>Amazon&apos;s Earnings This Week - Where&apos;s is AWS Cash Cow Headed?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Cyclical Dilemma: Is AWS at an AI Crossroads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon&apos;s latest earnings report, accompanied by a roughly 2.5% decline in pre-market trading, highlights investor concerns about cyclical pressures and profitability—particularly in its AWS cloud computing division. Amid escalating investments in artificial intelligence (AI), AWS faces critical questions that investors must consider: Will AWS overcome short-term cyclical headwinds, or is it at a crossroads that might redefine its future profitability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Profitability Pressures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS has historically been a primary profit driver for Amazon, often subsidizing investments into other segments, including e-commerce. However, recent earnings indicate rising operating costs and margin pressures, partly due to significant capital expenditure on AI infrastructure. Investors are rightfully concerned whether these costs will yield sustained returns or weigh down profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Amazon’s AI Strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike competitors such as Microsoft, which has rapidly monetized AI through Azure, Amazon has faced challenges demonstrating similar immediate returns from its AI investments. AWS’s expansive AI-related CapEx suggests potential long-term rewards, but investors must weigh these anticipated future benefits against immediate margin pressures and operational risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Insights: Metrics to Watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors focusing on Amazon should closely monitor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Operating Margins: Consistent improvements here could indicate successful AI integration and cost management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue Growth in AWS: Accelerated growth rates could reflect increased demand for AI-powered cloud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CapEx Efficiency: How efficiently Amazon converts its heavy investments into tangible, scalable revenue streams will significantly influence long-term valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Crossroads for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon investors face a strategic decision point. They must assess whether AWS’s current cyclical downturn represents an opportune moment to position for potential future upside or signals deeper structural challenges requiring caution. Investors should critically evaluate quarterly financial performance, particularly AWS-related metrics, as a litmus test of Amazon’s long-term AI strategy viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while AWS remains integral to Amazon’s long-term growth narrative, investors must carefully discern whether current cyclical pressures mask deeper profitability issues or offer a strategic entry point for future growth driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

It is being reported that the US is reluctant to drop the reciprocal 10% tariffs, alongside auto, steel, and aluminum tariffs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s hardly an optimistic sign on how Trump is setting his team to approach negotiations in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, Japan is hitting back at that and saying that they are firmly opposing the US&apos; proposal. Finance minister Kato even went as far as saying that they could even look at the country&apos;s Treasury holdings as &quot;a card&quot; in negotiations, but &quot;whether or not we use that card is a different decision&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The next discussion will only take place after the middle of May. So, that&apos;s the can being kicked down the road for yet another two weeks. So much for quick progress, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The stalemate serves as a warning for other countries as well, with the clock continuing to count down. Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were up 0.8% earlier in the day before paring a chunk of that to be up just 0.2% during the session. Overall, the animal spirits are still holding up but we&apos;ll see if that is enough to keep the win streak going in Wall Street to wrap up the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In FX, the dollar is once again offered amid the less than ideal trade headlines. EUR/USD pushed up above 1.1300 to 1.1340 while USD/JPY is down 0.6% to 144.50 currently, after hanging around 145.20 in the handover from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The euro is also getting some slight help from a hotter-than-expected Eurozone core inflation estimate for April. The jump was largely due to services inflation and that will give the ECB something to think about before the likely next rate cut in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, USD/CHF is also marked down by 0.6% to 0.8238 while AUD/USD is seen up 0.8% to 0.6434 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is up again in a push to $3,260 levels while bond yields are slightly down with 10-year Treasury yields in particular holding just under its 200-day moving average of 4.22% for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s on to the US jobs report next before eyeing more trade/Trump headlines before the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Connection: What Big Tech Earnings Tell Us About AI Demand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent earnings reports from tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon have not only captured investor attention but also provided crucial insights into the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this AI wave is NVIDIA, the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), essential hardware powering AI infrastructure. How might NVIDIA be impacted by the latest signals from big tech earnings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong AI Momentum From Microsoft and Meta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Meta have demonstrated substantial financial returns from their aggressive AI strategies. Microsoft&apos;s integration of OpenAI’s GPT technology into Azure and Meta’s robust AI-driven user engagement metrics suggest rapid growth in enterprise demand for AI capabilities. These developments directly increase the need for NVIDIA’s powerful GPUs, positioning NVIDIA as a significant beneficiary of the current AI expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple and Amazon: More Measured Approaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Apple and Amazon have displayed a more cautious or cyclical approach to AI. Apple’s incremental, quality-focused AI development could mean slower immediate demand for NVIDIA’s hardware, while Amazon’s mixed earnings from AWS indicate potential short-term constraints in GPU-related CapEx spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for NVIDIA Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors assessing NVIDIA’s outlook should closely track:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sustained strength of Microsoft’s and Meta’s AI-related earnings, indicating continued robust demand for NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of accelerated AI infrastructure investments from Apple and Amazon, potentially further boosting GPU demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic factors and tariff-related risks that could influence tech spending patterns broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight Through Competitor Comparisons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divergent strategies of these big tech firms offer valuable comparisons for NVIDIA investors. Microsoft&apos;s and Meta’s rapid and profitable AI adoption underscores the immediate positive potential for NVIDIA’s earnings. Meanwhile, the slower approaches of Amazon and Apple illustrate how varying AI strategies can impact hardware demand differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, recent big tech earnings provide clear signals of strong ongoing demand for AI infrastructure, particularly benefiting NVIDIA’s position as a critical hardware provider. Investors should closely monitor tech companies&apos; AI investment trajectories and NVIDIA&apos;s stock performance in the coming quarters for validation of these trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice. Investors should conduct independent research and make investment decisions at their own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For further insights and detailed market analysis, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt;, soon evolving into InvestingLive.com, providing enhanced coverage of stocks, commodities, and investing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join our free InvestingLive Stocks Telegram channel for regular updates, actionable trade ideas, and insightful long-term investment perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/investinglivestocks&quot;&gt;InvestingLive Stocks Telegram Channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Apple posted 5% revenue, net profit, and EPS growth in Q2 FY25 — in line with consensus. Management expects low-to-mid single-digit growth next quarter and a $900M tariff hit. iPhone China shipments (~7M) should meet U.S. demand, but margins are under pressure. Tariff risks could grow.

                            &lt;p&gt;Meta’s Quiet AI Revolution: More Profitable Than You Think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta Platforms&apos; recent earnings report underscores a crucial narrative investors shouldn&apos;t overlook—the company&apos;s highly effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Following the earnings release, Meta shares surged around 4.25% yesterday and continued to show resilience today, up an additional 0.9% pre-market. So, what&apos;s driving investor optimism, and how is Meta quietly becoming a top AI player?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI as a Direct Profit Driver for META Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many companies merely experimenting with AI, Meta is already achieving tangible returns. The company has successfully used AI to significantly enhance user engagement on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. With daily active users reaching 3.4 billion—over 60% of the global daily online population—Meta’s ability to sustain and grow user engagement through AI-driven personalization and content targeting is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margin Expansion at META&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta&apos;s investment in AI isn&apos;t just about boosting user numbers. AI implementation has also directly contributed to improved profitability. Meta recently reported operating margins at 41%, substantially surpassing market expectations. This profitability boost can partly be attributed to efficiency gains from AI-enhanced internal operations, including streamlined coding and content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta AI&apos;s Strategic Roadmap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta&apos;s continued strategic focus on AI, highlighting five key areas: engagement, content creation, business messaging, Meta AI chatbots, and hardware through Reality Labs. Investors should recognize this as a roadmap for sustained revenue growth and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta vs. Competitors: An Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Meta&apos;s aggressive AI integration strategy with the slower approaches of competitors like Apple provides investors a valuable benchmark. While Apple&apos;s cautious pace in AI raises market uncertainties, Meta’s swift execution demonstrates how proactive AI investments can immediately and substantially benefit earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should carefully watch Meta’s stock performance in the coming quarters, particularly noting whether this strong positive sentiment continues. Continued growth in user engagement metrics and sustained margin improvements will likely reinforce Meta&apos;s position as a leader in leveraging AI for profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, Meta’s quiet AI revolution is becoming loudly profitable, offering a compelling example for investors of how AI can transform corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

      <title>(My Local Feed) $AAPL: ROSENBLATT DOWNGRADES TO NEUTRAL FROM BUY - PT $217

&quot;We downgrade Apple to Neutral and cut our price target to $217 (from $223). iPhone demand beat low expectations, but AI-driven growth looks unlikely. Apple remains well-run but faces muted growth, lacks a breakout product, and trades at a premium in a tough regulatory and tariff environment.&quot;</title>

      <title>China&apos;s Impact on Big Tech Earnings: Mitigating Geopolitical Risks</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;China’s Shadow on Big Tech: Assessing Future Earnings Risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent earnings reports from major tech giants—Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have underscored an often-overlooked risk factor: China’s economic influence and the ongoing geopolitical tension affecting these corporations&apos; financial performance. As traders and investors digest recent stock moves, it&apos;s crucial to understand China&apos;s direct and indirect impacts on big tech earnings, now and in future quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct Impact: Production and Tariffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s latest earnings revealed significant vulnerability tied to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, with approximately 40-45% of Apple’s total revenue linked to China-based production. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged tariff-related costs could increase Apple&apos;s expenses by around $900 million in the upcoming quarter alone, pressuring profit margins significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indirect Impact: Market Access and Consumer Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta explicitly cited China&apos;s e-commerce platforms, such as Timu, as negatively affecting its revenue growth. Although Meta raised its full-year revenue guidance, it admitted the numbers would have been stronger without these external headwinds, demonstrating China’s influence beyond direct manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Shifts and Diversification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big tech companies are actively responding by diversifying production. Apple&apos;s notable shift of significant iPhone production to India and Vietnam reflects efforts to mitigate China-related risks. Investors should closely watch these strategies&apos; effectiveness, as continued dependence on China may expose companies to persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s Diversification Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Apple’s diversification strategy: shifting approximately half of U.S.-bound iPhone production to India. While this mitigates some tariff impacts, it also introduces logistical challenges and potential cost increases initially. Investors should watch closely to determine if such strategic shifts ultimately lead to sustainable margin improvements or if complications offset anticipated benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should remain vigilant about developments in U.S.-China relations, particularly ongoing tariff negotiations and regulatory changes. Future earnings reports will likely continue reflecting China’s multifaceted influence, emphasizing the importance of incorporating geopolitical risk analysis into investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while recent positive earnings from Microsoft and Meta are encouraging, investors must remain aware of China&apos;s considerable and complex role in shaping the future earnings landscape for big tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

      <title>Apple Earnings Takeaway: Apple&apos;s AI</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/news/apple-earnings-takeaway-apples-ai-20250502/</link>

                            &lt;p&gt;Apple’s AI Uncertainty: Opportunity or Risk for Investors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s latest earnings report presented investors with mixed signals. Despite solid overall performance—revenue up 5% year-over-year and services revenue climbing 12%—Apple’s stock experienced a notable drop, falling approximately 3% in pre-market trading today. What’s behind this market reaction, and why should investors pay close attention to Apple’s cautious stance on artificial intelligence (AI)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key factor influencing investor sentiment appears to be Apple&apos;s deliberate and careful approach to AI integration compared to its peers, such as Microsoft and Meta, who are rapidly scaling their AI investments. During Apple’s recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook highlighted ongoing uncertainties, particularly emphasizing Apple&apos;s commitment to high-quality AI products over speed to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should consider the following implications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delayed AI Rollouts: Apple’s personalized Siri enhancements and other AI-driven features have seen timelines pushed out, with some significant releases expected only by early 2026. This conservative rollout pace contrasts sharply with competitors aggressively monetizing AI features today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs and Supply Chain Risks: Apple&apos;s reliance on China for production remains substantial, despite efforts to diversify. With ongoing tariff uncertainties, any disruption can significantly impact profit margins, directly affecting Apple&apos;s ability to invest aggressively in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem Strength vs. Innovation Pace: Apple&apos;s robust ecosystem and strong customer loyalty offer a safety net. Yet, prolonged delays in AI innovation could erode competitive advantage, particularly if rivals significantly outperform in AI functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Apple&apos;s AI Strategy Impacts Stock Earnings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Meta’s recent earnings, where rapid AI integration significantly improved user engagement and margins, providing a direct and immediate positive impact on stock performance. Apple&apos;s slower trajectory contrasts with Meta&apos;s approach and serves as a valuable comparison for investors evaluating potential AI-driven returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors need to closely watch Apple’s progress over upcoming quarters, particularly observing if investor patience holds firm. Sustained stock weakness beyond immediate reactions to earnings reports could signal deeper market concerns regarding Apple&apos;s cautious AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Apple&apos;s prudence and meticulous quality control have traditionally served it well, investors must carefully balance these advantages against potential competitive risks posed by the accelerated pace of AI innovation in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is intended for market commentary purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

      <title>A year ago Bill Gross predicted the path of Treasury yields, was he right?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;A year ago, the old Bond King &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/bill-gross-look-for-10-year-yields-to-rise-above-5-over-the-next-12-months-20240502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;made a prediction&lt;/a&gt; about the path of Treasury yields. At the time, the 10-year was trading at 4.57% and he thought they were going higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those that argue for lower rates have to counter the inexorable upward climb in Treasury supply and the likely Sisyphean decline in bond prices,&quot; Gross writes. &quot;Look for 5% plus 10-year yields over the next 12 months — not 4.0%. Those that argue for lower rates have to counter the inexorable upward climb in Treasury supply and the likely Sisyphean decline in bond prices. Total Return is dead. Don’t let them sell you a bond fund.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should have bought that bond fund...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next five months, 10-year yields fell to 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, they later rebounded to 4.8% but now sit about 40 bps below his call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile. the US fiscal picture continues to deteriorate and indications from Trump&apos;s upcoming tax bill offer few signs that lowering the deficit -- which is at 7% of GDP -- is a priority. DOGE is proving to be little more than a distraction and any revenue from tariffs will be dwarfed by the cost of new tax cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point Gross will be right and those deficits will matter but that wasn&apos;t in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s the future supply of Treasuries that I want to address. The outstanding balance of Treasuries has been increasing at a 10%+ annual rate for the past 18 months — a result of fiscal post-Covid deficits of 2-3 trillion dollars. At the end of 2023’s fourth quarter there was nearly 30 trillion of outstanding public debt issued by the Federal government, growing at 10% a year,&quot; he wrote 12 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God forbid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-april-consumer-confidence-860-vs-875-expected-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;consumers are right&lt;/a&gt; about 7% inflation in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Well, this is not going well... The problem here is that the US might want to keep 10% for everyone and sell it as good news, which the market might even like (considering that it&apos;s still much lower than what was announced on April 2), but the Japanese are not budging on it.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Why it&apos;s important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ranges of estimates are 
important in terms of market reaction because when the actual data deviates from the 
expectations, it creates a surprise effect. Another
 important input in market&apos;s reaction is the distribution of forecasts. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although we can have a range of 
estimates, most forecasts might be clustered on the upper bound of the 
range, so even if the data comes out inside the range of estimates but 
on the lower bound of the range, it can still create a surprise effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Farm Payrolls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25K-195K range of estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;120K-160K range most clustered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;130K consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment Rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.3% (9%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.2% (79%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.1% (12%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Hourly Earnings Y/Y&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.9% (70%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.8% (27%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.8% (3%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Hourly Earnings M/M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.4% (2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.3% (80%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.2% (18%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Weekly Hours &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.2 (79%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.1 (18%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.0 (3%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&apos;ve been saying from April 2, I don&apos;t think the data matters now as the focus remains on trade negotiations. The same way the data was influenced by the uncertainty about tariffs and then the fear of recession following the April 2 announcement, it will also be influenced by the first trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, say we get positive outcomes on the trade deals, the market will start to price in an improvement in the economy and even though the data might still show weakness in the first months, the market will likely just fade the negative reaction and keep going up on positive future expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the only outcome in the data that would trigger a market reaction is a notable weakening in the labour market as it would give the Fed a reason to cut rates. The US jobless claims, which is the most timely labour market data, continues to show a stable environment despite some volatility in the data caused by one-off factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you get less hiring given the economic uncertainty, but we haven&apos;t seen layoffs picking up yet. It&apos;s just a frozen labour market as businesses await more info on the tariffs front. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s AI Leap: Why Investors Should Pay Attention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings report has turned heads in the investing community, as shares surged dramatically by 7.63% yesterday, breaking decisively above the significant psychological threshold of $400 and currently trading around $425 in pre-market. But what specifically is fueling this bullish response, and what does it mean for investors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Microsoft&apos;s impressive earnings momentum lies a focused and strategic bet on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through its Azure cloud platform. Microsoft&apos;s substantial investments in AI have shown clear and tangible returns, especially through its integration with OpenAI’s GPT technology. This integration has positioned Azure as a formidable competitor in the rapidly growing AI and cloud computing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have reason to be optimistic about Microsoft&apos;s AI strategy due to several key factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediate Revenue Impact: Microsoft&apos;s aggressive move into AI has directly boosted its cloud revenue. Azure’s AI-driven services have attracted significant enterprise clients, bolstering recurring revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive Advantage: By integrating AI deeply into its products, Microsoft creates stronger value propositions, boosting customer retention and increasing pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalable Growth: AI investments tend to scale effectively once infrastructure costs are absorbed, suggesting potential margin expansions and sustainable earnings growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from an Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Microsoft&apos;s recent implementation of AI-powered features in its Office 365 productivity suite, particularly &quot;Copilot.&quot; Initial customer responses indicate a willingness to pay premium prices for enhanced productivity features, reflecting the immediate financial upside of strategic AI integration. This is a tangible demonstration of how Microsoft&apos;s AI focus translates directly into higher revenue and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor Microsoft&apos;s stock performance over the next several quarters. Sustaining prices comfortably above the $400 level will validate continued investor confidence and signal that Microsoft&apos;s AI strategy is robust and well-executed. Conversely, a sharp reversal below this threshold would warrant caution and reevaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Microsoft&apos;s AI-driven earnings leap is not just impressive—it&apos;s instructive. It offers traders and investors a clear case study of how targeted AI investments can rapidly translate into shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is intended for market commentary purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

      <title>Earnings Reports of Big Tech: CapEx Surge in AI</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;CapEx Surge in AI: Smart Investment or Investor Trap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon spotlight a substantial rise in capital expenditures (CapEx), primarily driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. But traders and investors alike are now grappling with a key question: Will this massive spending spree pay off, or is it potentially trapping investors in a costly, overextended bet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings report was particularly impressive, with the stock surging 7.63% yesterday and maintaining strength in pre-market trading today. Microsoft shares decisively broke above the critical psychological level of $400, currently trading around $425, underscoring investor confidence in its AI strategy, particularly Azure’s deep integration with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Meta&apos;s earnings report showed robust results, with shares jumping about 4.25% yesterday and adding an additional 0.9% in pre-market today, indicating sustained investor enthusiasm. Meta&apos;s results suggest strong momentum driven by AI-enhanced user engagement and significantly improved margins, pointing to AI expenditures translating into immediate and tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Apple has seen more cautious investor reactions. Despite reporting solid revenue growth of 5% and service revenue up 12%, Apple shares dropped approximately 3% in pre-market trading today, primarily due to uncertainty surrounding future quarters and tariff implications cited by CEO Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon is also facing investor scrutiny despite continued investments in AI, with shares currently down around 2.5% pre-market. Amazon’s AWS unit is under particular pressure, raising questions about profitability despite the ongoing surge in AI-related CapEx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mixed reactions to earnings reports highlight the broader uncertainty about whether substantial AI-related CapEx will yield long-term returns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &amp;amp; Meta: Clearly leading in translating AI investments into immediate growth and margin expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple &amp;amp; Amazon: Exhibiting caution and facing market skepticism amid slower returns and macroeconomic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor upcoming quarters to validate whether these extensive CapEx investments in AI infrastructure lead to sustainable earnings growth or instead create substantial cost burdens, especially if macroeconomic conditions worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, traders should rely on price action as their primary indicator—no matter how compelling an earnings report or optimistic a corporate forecast appears. Sustained share-price strength or weakness over the coming weeks will deliver the market’s final verdict on these ambitious AI expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&apos;s rise to the U.S. presidency was marked by a series
of bold and unconventional policy proposals that many pundits deemed radical at
the time. Given the length of the campaign and the public nature of his
platform, one would think that the market had plenty of time to prepare and
price in the potential policy shifts well in advance. However, it turned out
that investors were caught off guard by the extent of the upheaval that ensued.
Indeed, the first 100 days of Donald Trump&apos;s presidency were characterised by
extreme volatility and uncertainty for the global financial markets. In this
article, Octa broker reviews Trump&apos;s policies and analyses their consequences
for the global financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump assumed office on 20 January 2025, and market
volatility has been rising ever since. Some of Trump&apos;s initiatives,
particularly his aggressive trade policies, have sent shockwaves through
equities, currencies, and commodities, leaving retail forex traders scrambling
to adjust. Meanwhile, larger investors struggled to adapt to the rapid pace of
proposed reforms and their far-reaching consequences. Overall, the first 100
days of President Trump saw heightened risk aversion and widespread uncertainty,
which resulted in sharp fluctuations in asset prices and currency exchange
rates as traders reacted to every policy announcement, tweet, and speech from
President Trump and his new administration.Below is a list of just a few of the notable days that shook the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major market-moving events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●20 January. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)
dropped by more than 1.20% after news surfaced that the new administration will
not immediately impose trade tariffs, prompting a rally in the currencies of
some U.S. trading partners: notably, the Mexican peso (MXN), the Euro (EUR) and
the Canadian dollar (CAD). It should be noted that prior to the sharp decline,
the greenback had been rising almost uninterruptedly since September 2024,
almost reaching a three-year high ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration as the market
assumed that higher tariffs would spur inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve
(Fed) to pursue a more hawkish monetary policy. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●1–3 February. In the future, historians may
label 1 February as the official start of a global trade war. On this day,
Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with
an additional 10% tariff on China. The market&apos;s reaction was highly negative.
U.S. stock futures slumped in early Asian trading on Monday, 3 February, with
Nasdaq futures down 2.35% and S&amp;amp;P 500 futures 1.8% lower. U.S. oil prices
jumped more than $2, while gasoline futures jumped more than 3%. Meanwhile, the
Canadian dollar and Mexican peso weakened substantially, with USDCAD surging
past the 1.47900 mark, a 22-year high, and USDMXN touching a 3-year high as
economists warned that both countries were at risk of recession once the
tariffs kick in. Later that day, Trump agreed to delay 25% tariffs on Canada
and Mexico for a month after both countries agreed to take tougher measures to
combat migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●3–5 March. This is when the market began to
seriously worry about the health of the global economy and a risk-off sentiment
became evident. As fresh 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada,
along with the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, were scheduled to take effect on 4
March, investors started to sell-off the greenback and flock into gold (XAUUSD)
as well as into alternative safe-haven currencies, such as the Swiss franc
(CHF) and the Japanese yen (JPY). In just three trading sessions (from 3–5
March), DXY plunged by more than 3% while the gold price gained more than 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●6 March. Donald
Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve.
However, it was unclear how exactly this reserve would work and just how much
it would differ from Bitcoin holdings already in place. Many crypto enthusiasts
were disappointed, which triggered a five-day downturn in BTCUSD, culminating
in Bitcoin briefly dipping below the crucial $80,000 level on 10 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●2 April. The trade war entered the next
stage when Trump unveiled his long-promised &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariffs strategy,
essentially imposing import duties on more than a hundred countries. The market
route began with equity markets losing billions of dollars in valuation.
S&amp;amp;P 500 lost more than 11% in just two days, while DXY dropped to a fresh
six-month low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●9–11 April. Trade war drama continued to
unfold. Financial markets were stunned by President Trump&apos;s abrupt reversal on
tariffs. Duties on trading partners, which had taken effect less than 24 hours
prior, were largely rolled back as the President announced a 90-day freeze on
the reciprocal tariffs. However, a 10% blanket tariff was still applied to most
nations. In contrast, the trade conflict with China escalated sharply.
Following China&apos;s 84% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, the U.S. increased
tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. This, combined with existing duties,
brought the total U.S. tariff burden on Chinese imports to 145%. Kar Yong Ang,
a financial market analyst at Octa broker, comments: &apos;I will remember that day for a long
time. Traders were stunned by Trump&apos;s sudden U-turn on trade policy and really
struggled to make sense of it all. A knee-jerk reaction was to simply buy gold
and ask questions later.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from country-based tariffs, Trump also introduced additional
import tariffs on aluminium and steel and ordered a probe into duties on copper
imports. Overall, his aggressive trade policies have fueled speculation about
the global recession, which explains why gold has been one of the
best-performing assets since Trump took office. Kar Yong Ang comments: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&apos;We are
dealing with a rather unusual situation. Even a global depression is not out of
the question as tariffs may disrupt supply chains, hurting global output while
also contributing to stronger inflationary pressure. This will certainly
complicate monetary policy decisions. If I were to describe Trump&apos;s first 100
days in just two words, it would be &quot;run
for safety&quot;.&apos; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Trump&apos;s recent public criticism of Jerome Powell, the Fed&apos;s
Chairman, added more fuel to the fire of nervous investor sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the full effect of Trump&apos;s policies is yet to materialise,
but the potential impact on global trade and the macroeconomy is substantial.
The IMF, citing escalating trade tensions, downgraded its 2025 global growth
forecast to 2.8% and warned of potential stock market crashes and a 7%
contraction in the world economy should trade wars persist. Although Scott
Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, hinted at de-escalating U.S.-China trade
tensions, it is clear that investors should still get used to living in a
period of heightened volatility and uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kar Yong Ang has this advice for an average retail trader: &apos;Focus more
on short-term trades with tight stop-losses as opposed to long-term
position-trading, cut exposure to U.S. equities, diversify into gold and other
safe-haven currencies like Swiss franc and most importantly, keep your mind
clear and be ready to quickly switch from one position to another&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance reminder:
trading Contracts for Difference (CFDs)
carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.
Emotional trading can increase this risk. Always trade within your means and
understand the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Octa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.octafx.com?utm_source=media&amp;amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TrumpsFirst100Days&amp;amp;utm_content=ww_fx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Octa&lt;/a&gt; is an international broker that has

Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD continues to be
supported amid the ongoing de-escalation in trade wars. This has most likely to
do with positioning rather than fundamentals. The short dollar trade got very
overstretched so positive news on the tariffs front is providing a pullback. In
the medium term, the US Dollar should keep on depreciating as the path of least
resistance for the Fed remains to cut rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it’s been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. On the monetary policy
front, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-japan-leaves-policy-unchanged-as-widely-expected-20250501/&quot;&gt;BoJ&lt;/a&gt; kept interest rates unchanged as expected and
delivered a dovish message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was then echoed by BoJ
Governor Ueda which placed a great deal on trade war developments. In summary,
the central bank is likely to go faster on rate hikes in case we get a good
trade deal and delay rate adjustments in case the trade deal disappoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY continues to pull back from the key 140.00 handle. From a risk
management perspective, the sellers will have a better risk to reward setup
around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; to position for further
downside, while the buyers will look for a break higher to increase the bullish
bets into the 151.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we have an upward minor trendline defining the bullish momentum. If we
get a pullback, the buyers will likely lean on the trendline to position for a
rally into the major trendline, while the sellers will look for a break lower
to increase the bearish bets into the 140.00 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, there’s
not much else we can add here as chasing the rally at these levels doesn’t look
good. We have also the US NFP report today which could provide a pullback in
case the data is weaker than expected. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we conclude the week with the US NFP report but
watch out for tariff related news as that’s what really matters for the market
now. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 48.6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The headline reading is a 32-month high while the output index also improved to 51.5, up from 50.5 in March, and that&apos;s a 37-month high. It&apos;s a positive sign to start Q2 as the euro area industry looks to stabilise, helped by meaningful improvements in France and Germany in particular. That said, the path ahead remains uncertain; not least with US tariffs still clouding the outlook. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“A fourth consecutive increase in the HCOB PMI can be seen as a sign that the situation in the manufacturing sector is
stabilising. This comes as a surprise given the many uncertainties and shocks of recent months. However, the situation
remains fragile, as evidenced by the fact that the headline index remains below the threshold value of 50. Industrial activity
remains highly exposed to US tariff policy, but the planned sharp increase in defence spending in the EU could help stabilise
the situation in the long term. This is confirmed by the survey’s optimism gauge, which is relatively elevated when compared
with the trend over the past three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“The near stabilisation of the industrial economy was helped by a production pick-up in both Germany and France in April,
and Italy is fighting its way back into expansion territory. This may have been spurred by the fall in oil and gas prices in April,
and this was underscored by a decline in input prices, which had risen in each of the three months prior. Interest rate cuts by
the ECB and the prospect of further monetary easing are also likely to have been welcome news for companies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;“Manufacturers were clearly able to expand their profit margins in April, as purchasing prices fell while selling prices rose at
their fastest pace in two years. This is unlikely to continue, however, as US tariff policy is likely to see Chinese goods being
offered more widely in the EU, intensifying competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 48.3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HCOB Germany Manufacturing PMI at 32-month high.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HCOB Germany Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 37-month high.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business expectations ease to weakest in four months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the headline PMI moving closer to the neutral 50 mark, one might think that German industry is gradually emerging
from a downturn that has lasted almost three years. After all, manufacturers have expanded production for the second
month in a row. It doesn&apos;t take a crystal ball to see that the road ahead will be bumpy, though. US tariffs and the associated
uncertainty are going to weigh on German exporters. And it is quite possible that the expansion in production over the past
two months is due to pull-forward effects in connection with the impending US tariff increases, which means that there might
be a backlash in the coming months.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite global headwinds, German manufacturers recorded a marginal increase in export orders for the first time in over
three years. This supported a second straight monthly rise in overall order intakes. Orders from the German Bundeswehr are
probably not yet playing a decisive role here, but many companies – defence contractors, but also vehicle and drone
manufacturers and producers of optical equipment, for example – are likely to benefit from the planned additional defence
spending in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Falling energy prices are helping German industry. The drop in oil and gas prices due to increased fears of recession in the
US is reflected in lower purchase prices and is helping manufacturers to expand their profit margins. This is even more the
case as sales prices rose slightly in April for the first time in nearly two years.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 48.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s a modest revision higher with output rising for the first time in nearly three years. Overall, industry activity is still seen contracting but there is some underlying improvement at least. That said, there are softness in the data with employment, purchasing, and stocks all declining on the month. HCOB notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Since the beginning of 2025, the French manufacturing PMI has shown tentative signs of recovery, with the headline index
nearing the growth level and output increasing for the first time in almost three years in April. This upswing comes as a bit of
a surprise, given the turbulence over the past few weeks and the darkened outlook for global trade.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Orders from both domestic and foreign clients remain in contraction, albeit at a significantly reduced rate. This suggests
potential improvements in underlying business conditions within the manufacturing sector. While US tariffs are expected to
negatively impact French manufacturing and heighten uncertainty, lower interest rates from the ECB and credible EU efforts
to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and massively increase defence spending could stimulate manufacturing activity. On that
note, future business expectations have risen to their highest level in nearly a year. Despite this, French manufacturers
continue to reduce staffing levels, although the reduction was relatively moderate. Anecdotal evidence indicates that
workforce capacity was streamlined by not replacing departing employees and opting against renewing fixed-term contracts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Price dynamics are not a major concern. Input prices have only seen a slight increase, likely benefiting from the decline in
energy prices, particularly oil and gas, driven by recession fears. Factory gate charges have decreased for the second
consecutive month due to competitive pressures.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;A sub-sectoral analysis revealed no significant changes from the previous month across the consumer, intermediate, and
investment goods segments. Consumer goods producers experienced a slight improvement in conditions once again, while
the intermediate and investment goods sectors remained marginally below the growth threshold.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 46.6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Output nearly stabilises, having declined in the 12 months prior to April
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Softest contraction in new orders in over a year
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost pressures cool further, but charge inflation intensifies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This appears to indicate stabilisation, despite US tariff policy. After declining almost continuously since April 2024,
production has now almost reached the 50 mark, signalling that production is roughly at the same level as in the previous
month. The turnaround also seems to be emerging in terms of new orders, where the decline is significantly milder than in
previous months. This aligns with the fact that inventories of pre-production goods were reduced only slightly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the improved survey results, growth is once again within the realm of possibility. However, after the sector has been
in recession almost continuously since mid-2022, Italian industry will have to work its way out of a rather deep hole. There
will still be a number of obstacles along the way, chief among them the US tariff policy and the threat of intensified
competition from China, which will push even more products onto the European market than before.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher tariffs and uncertainty are weighing on Italian industry, which is reflected in the below-average optimism of
manufacturers. However, a more severe slump in sentiment could well have been expected. The fact that the PMI figures
signal stabilisation rather than a sharp deterioration may have something to do with the fact that industry is still benefiting
from some advance deals designed to circumvent higher tariffs. In addition, the defence industry is likely to see higher
demand for defence equipment, which should have a knock-on effect on the entire manufacturing sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 49.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steepest cut in new orders since December 2023
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Output down modestly for first time since last August
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confidence in outlook deteriorates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the PMI data, Jonas Feldhusen, Junior Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Operating conditions in Spain&apos;s Manufacturing Sector are deteriorating. The HCOB Manufacturing PMI stays in the
contraction zone for the third consecutive month and has even deteriorated compared to the previous month. This result is
underpinned by a decline in output, for the first time since August 2024, and a significant deterioration in order volumes.
Panellists report increased uncertainty and market instability, prompting customers to delay or cancel purchasing and
investment decisions. The instability of international markets is attributed to US tariff policies and the uncertainty that
accompanies it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decline in sentiment has not yet impacted employment levels. For four months, the employment index has signalled
little change. Given the poorer order situation and a reduction in backlogs, there is room for a deterioration in employment
levels in the coming months. Against this backdrop, business expectations of Spanish manufacturers also weakened in April.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Price dynamics in Spain&apos;s manufacturing sector have nearly come to a halt at the start of the second quarter. Input price
inflation has further weakened, as some vendors were forced to lower their prices due to weak demand. Pricing power for
customer prices was also limited, attributed to high competitive pressures and discounts to attract clients.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time this year, all sub-sectors – consumer, intermediate, and investment goods – are in the contraction zone.
The decline in intermediate goods was the most pronounced. Production there was cut, orders collapsed, and consequently,
business expectations plummeted. The consumer goods sector also declined but performed relatively better. Despite
weaker operating conditions overall, employment growth in this sector continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is reported that the US proposal was a framework that included reluctance to lowering tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum. This was what is being proposed by the US camp with it being centered on reciprocal tariffs. Considering said proposal, Japan negotiators are firmly opposed to it according to the media outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Adding that Japan is to take a stance that negotiations on reducing the US trade deficit will be difficult unless tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum are on the negotiating table. No easy deals, huh? *wink* *wink*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Again, this was supposed to be one of the easier negotiations for the US administration to manage. But from the look of things, it seems far from it. And when you weigh the comments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-eco-min-akazawa-says-no-comment-on-specifics-of-tariff-negotiations-with-trump-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;how the talks yesterday went&lt;/a&gt;, it didn&apos;t feel like there was too much progress whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The two camps are now expected to meet again after mid-May, according to Akazawa. So, that just kicks the can down the road for at least another two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
