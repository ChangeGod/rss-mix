                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s a much stronger promise than what was initially reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/india-reportedly-offers-to-cut-tariffs-gap-by-two-thirds-to-seal-trade-deal-with-the-us-20250509/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It will be interesting to see what Trump is offering back in return though. Will India be able to buy an exemption? Or is there still going to be the 10% baseline?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With his visit to the Middle East, Trump is turning his attention to other geopolitical matters this week. For markets in general, all of this at least buys further reprieve on the trade front after the US and China settled on a 90-day de-escalation since the weekend. As for the topic itself, Iran continues to defend their stance and not give in though. However, they did at least outline clear terms for accepting a deal but it remains to be seen if Ali Khamenei will be on board if the US can deliver as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The comments are putting a drag on oil though, with WTI crude down over 3% on the day now to $60.62.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;We have a very busy day ahead on the data front. In the European session, there won&apos;t be that much as we just get the Eurozone Q1 GDP (2nd estimate) and the Eurozone Employment Change data. Both of them are old news and rarely market moving releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have lots of data but the main highlights include the US PPI, US Jobless Claims and US Retail Sales. The Core PPI Y/Y is expected at 3.1% vs. 3.3% prior, while the M/M reading is seen at 0.3% vs. -0.1% prior. I think the focus switched back to inflation so watch out for surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Initial Claims are expected at 229K vs. 228K prior, while Continuing Claims are seen at 1890K vs. 1879K prior. The US Jobless
Claims continue to be one of the most important releases to follow every week
as it’s a timelier indicator on the state of the labour market.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They haven&apos;t been market moving for several months because the data never surprised. Initial Claims remain below the cycle high at 260K. We will likely need a spike above that level to trigger a market reaction. Some analysts are suggesting we could see higher readings due to some seasonal patterns in the next weeks but as long as we stay below that 260K level, it should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Retail Sales M/M is expected at 0.0% vs. 1.5% prior, while the ex-Autos measure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.6% prior. The Control Group is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.4% prior. I don&apos;t really care about retail sales data myself because it&apos;s a volatile data set. Goldman Sachs expects core retail sales to rise in April as consumers frontloaded purchases ahead of impending tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;06:00 GMT - ECB&apos;s Cipollone (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;06:50 GMT - ECB&apos;s Elderson (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12:40 GMT/08:40 ET - Fed Chair Powell (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14:00 GMT/10:00 ET - BoE&apos;s Dhingra (uber dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18:05 GMT/14:05 ET - Fed&apos;s Barr (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The breakdown shows producer prices rising by 0.2% on the month while import prices were flat in April. Compared to the same month a year ago, the overall index is down 0.5% with the chunk of that owing to a decline in import prices (-1.8%).&lt;/p&gt;

It reaffirms a solid showing in the UK economy in the first quarter of the year at least.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The meeting on the sidelines here is said to involve US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and China&apos;s trade envoy, Li Chenggang. This as both parties were in attendance of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference. No further details are given on the engagement yet. But considering that it is just a pull aside conversation, there shouldn&apos;t be too much in it.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are a couple to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The first one is for EUR/USD at the 1.1200 level. That might act as a bit of a magnet in trapping price action in between its key hourly moving averages in the session ahead at least. That especially after the upside run yesterday stalled at the 200-hour moving average. The key technical level is seen at 1.1249 currently with the 100-hour moving average seen at 1.1180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, there is one for AUD/USD at the 0.6475 level. It isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance with the pair struggling to get above 0.6500 in the bigger picture for the time being. So, the figure level takes on more importance in terms of limiting upside for the pair at this current point in time. The expiries should have negligible impact but could offer to hold upside during the session at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And lastly, there is one for NZD/USD at the 0.5880 level. That rests nearby the 200-day moving average of 0.5880 and might offer to keep price action stickier in the session ahead. The lows earlier in the week around 0.5850 will act as a secondary layer of short-term support. But trading sentiment will continue to be largely dictated by risk flows and dollar sentiment still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;59 of 62 economists (95%) see no change to interest rates in June meeting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;39 of 58 economists (67%) see interest rates staying unchanged in Q3 (previously 36%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;30 of 58 economists (52%) see at least one more rate hike by year-end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The median prediction for end-September rate is now 0.50% (previously 0.75%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The median prediction for year-end rate is 0.75% (unchanged)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;16 of 29 economists (55%) either strongly or somewhat approve of the Japanese government&apos;s approach to tariff negotiations with the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In terms of market pricing, traders are seeing ~98% odds of no change in the upcoming meeting in June. As for the year itself, there&apos;s only ~17 bps priced in currently by the final meeting in December. So, that fits with the above view somewhat - at least through Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

Oil
prices dropped quickly in early Asia after significant comments from
a top
adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He
said that Iran
would agree
to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;never
making nuclear weapons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;getting
rid of its stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;allow
international inspectors to supervise the process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;in
exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions on Iran. He said Iran was ready to sign such an agreement today. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;After
the drop price falls extended lower, an oil chart is posted below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;News
flow was light otherwise. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;From
Australia we had a the latest employment report, for April. 89,000
jobs were added, the biggest monthly increase in 14 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;59,500
of those full-time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, not too far off 5-decade lows.
The participation rate rose to a record high 67.1%, meaning more
entrants into the labour market keeping the jobless rate unchanged on
the month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The
Reserve Bank of Australia meet next week, May 19 and 20, and despite
this solid jobs report are still expected to cut their cash rate by
25bp. The
Australian dollar popped a few points after the data release but
there has been no extentison higher as yet. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;EUR,
GBP, NZD, CAD are all a little higher on the session. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;USD/JPY
lost some ground on no news or data flow. As I post its testing its session lows around 146.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Gold
lost further ground on the session. China has been a reliable buyer
during the timezone but supportive flows from there have diminished. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
Treasury yields rose higher. Markets are questioning whether the rise
in yield reflects expectations of better growth ahead, or
expectations of some sort of reckoning to come with US debt
continuing to skyrocket. Trump’s plan had been to replace income
taxes with tariff revenue, to control the US debt/GDP ratio, but,
while tax cuts are still being planned, the tariff revenue dream is
looking lost.

                            &lt;p&gt;This is not directly about financial markets, but it might be of interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the current discourse on Taiwan centres around one scenario: war. The prevailing imagery involves amphibious landings, missile strikes, and an Indo-Pacific showdown with global ramifications. Yet the most plausible outcome may be the one least discussed: China could secure Taiwan without firing a shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... victory can be achieved not through kinetic escalation but through the slow erosion of political cohesion, economic independence, and societal confidence, all without triggering a Western military response. The signs are already visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to convince Taiwan that reunification is just. It is to persuade it that reunification is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the link if you want to read it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/beiping-model-how-china-could-absorb-taiwan-without-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Beiping model: How China

                            &lt;p&gt;Trade representatives of APEC member economies are meeting today and tomorrow. To discuss multilateral trade and other cooperation agendas, including reforms of the World Trade Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines via Reuters: APEC sees regional GDP growth for 2025 at 2.6% down from 3.3% earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees export growth for 2025 at 0.4% versus 5.7% in 2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees unprecedented rise in trade policy uncertainty fueled by frictions amplifies risks to growth for trade-dependent economies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees trade policy volatility in April is 9 times greater than average of 2015–2024&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Export outlook downgrade due largely to US tariffs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APEC stands for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
It is a regional economic forum established in 1989 to promote free trade and economic cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;APEC has 21 member economies, including the United States, China, Japan, Australia, and most major economies bordering the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Australian April 2025 jobs data is here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-april-2025-unemployment-rate-41-vs-41-expected-employment-change-890k-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Australia April 2025 unemployment rate 4.1% (vs. 4.1% expected) &amp;amp; Employment Change +89.0K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;89,000 jobs were added, thebiggest monthly increase in 14 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;59,500 of those full-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a strong, strong result. The consensus analyst expectation was for 20,000 jobs to be added, so the result was more than 4 times that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking some shine off the result is the unemployment rate steady at 4.1%, so no inroads into the jobless rate. Still 4.1% is not too far off 5 decade lows. The participation rate rose to a record high 67.1%. More entrants into the l;about market has held the jobless rate steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said in the data post, this report ushers in the prospect of no rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. the Bank meets on May 19 and 20 and expectations have been wide for a 25bp rate cut. Those expectations will wobble a little on this report. Add in a calming in markets after the US-China ceasefire in Trump&apos;s trade tariff war and its not difficult seeing the RBA holding steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this stage I&apos;m still in the 25bp rate cut camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar popped a few points higher on the report, but so far with no follow-through. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Wow! Big jobs added number, &amp;gt;4* expected! The bulk of that full-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to fuel speculation of no Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut next week. Expectations were widely held of a 25bp cut on May 20. Mix in a calming of Trump&apos;s trade wars and its not too much of a stretch to see the Reserve Bank of Australia on hold next week. The meeting is live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment Change +89.0K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected +20K, prior +32.2K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-Time Employment +59.5K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prior +15K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part-Time Employment +29.5K&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prior +17.2K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment Rate 4.1%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected 4.1%, prior 4.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participation Rate 67.1%, a record high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expected 66.8%, prior 66.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous close was 7.2090&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBOC injected 64.5bn yuan via 7-day reverse repos at 1.40% &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;158.6bn yuan mature today

      <title>Chinese financial media reports, again, that there is room for cuts to the RRR  this year</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;In a China Securities Journal article analysts say they see space for further cuts to China&apos;s Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) this year. By 100 to 200 bp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China last cut the RRR on May 7. A 50bp cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d suggest it&apos;ll be many months before we see another cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) is a central bank regulation that sets the minimum amount of reserves each bank must hold in relation to their deposit liabilities. Its the percentage of total deposits that banks are legally required to keep on hand, either as cash in their vaults or in a reserve account at the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In China, this ratio is set by the People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By adjusting the RRR, the PBOC can influence the lending capacity of commercial banks. For example, an increase in RRR means that banks have less money to lend out because they have to keep more in reserve. This reduces the money supply in the economy. Conversely, if the PBOC decreases the reserve ratio, banks have more money to lend because they are required to keep less in reserve. This increases the money supply in the economy, which can stimulate economic activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
