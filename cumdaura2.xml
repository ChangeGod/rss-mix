                            &lt;p&gt;The gold buyers are back in a big way following the holiday in China and other parts of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold surged yesterday and traced out an outside bullish reversal. That pattern extended today in a powerful signal for gold buyers. If we close here it will be the second-best closing level ever and just $10 from the closing record on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big level though is $3500, which is where gold stalled on April 22. That was followed by a heavy round of profit taking that coincided with optimism about US trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately though, progress appears to have stalled. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today confirmed that the US and China aren&apos;t talking. He continued to tease other trade deals but the market is at the point where it wants to see less talk and more signed papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump today said he&apos;s tired of questions about when deals would be struck and &quot;we&apos;re going to put down the price the people are going to have to pay to shop in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going to put very fair numbers down, and we&apos;re going to say, here&apos;s â€“ what this country, what we want. And congratulations, we have a deal. And they&apos;ll either say &apos;great,&apos; and they&apos;ll start shopping, or they&apos;ll say, not good,&apos;&quot; Trump said alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;&quot;It&apos;s going to be a very fair number, it&apos;ll be a low number. We&apos;re not looking to hurt countries,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;This all sounds like improvisation and Trump has likely been emboldened by the bounce back in stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s there. It&apos;s good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some things of USMCA will have to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We won&apos;t do much business with Canada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dealing more with concepts right now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are paying tariffs and steel right now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We dont really want cars from Canada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At some point it won&apos;t make economic sense for Canada to build these cars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no reason for us to subsidize Canada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We subsidize Canada $200B a year.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a transformational leader&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been elected to transform Canada with focus on the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;History is Canada â€“ US stronger when we work together&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canada is not for sale and would never be for sale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My government is commited for a step change in providing international security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some things on USMCA will have to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a bigger discussion which will take time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what it is worth, Trump ended by saying US subsidizes Canada by $200B per year which is a little high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US/Canada goods deficit is more like $63.3 billion in 2024 with a trader surplus of $31.7 billion for a net deficit of about $32B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For NATO, it is calculated that Canada owes around $20B more per year.  So overall, the $200B is exaggerated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDCAD has moved lower and trades to a new low for the year and looks to the 61.8% of the move up from the 2023 low. That level comes in at 1.37415.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;USD/CAD has been in a 150-pip range since April 15 but it&apos;s near the low end of that range at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect the loonie to move on the tone and comments from today&apos;s Trump-Carney meeting but at the end of the day, it&apos;s just one meeting in what will be a long relationship between two newly-elected leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not clear when they will address reporters but that&apos;s the usual protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;178&quot; data-end=&quot;443&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD is pushing toward the top of a key swing area, testing resistance near 0.6000, which sits just below the 2024 high. This marks the 11th test of this zone, and the pair continues to find sellers on approaches, keeping the ceiling well-defined. Nevertheless, a break above would target the high from 2025 at 0.60281.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;445&quot; data-end=&quot;789&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The move to the upside was helped over the last few days by support holding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last Thursday, buyers leaned against a rising trend line, which held support and helped set the stage for the current bullish move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Friday, and at the start of trading on Monday, the price corrected down to the 100-hour moving average and found support buyers. Bullish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today, the low price held above both the 100-hour moving average and the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chartâ€”a dual technical confirmation that invited fresh upside interest. Bullish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;791&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While momentum has carried the pair back to recent highs, the area between 0.5994 and 0.6000 remains a stubborn barrier. A break above this zone would likely trigger stops and open the door toward a retest of the 2024 high near 0.6028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1036&quot; data-end=&quot;1074&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, watch for support at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1075&quot; data-end=&quot;1202&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1075&quot; data-end=&quot;1124&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1077&quot; data-end=&quot;1124&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.5960â€“0.5950 (near short-term swing lows),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1125&quot; data-end=&quot;1202&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1127&quot; data-end=&quot;1202&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Followed by the 100-hour MA and trend line support near 0.5920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1209&quot; data-end=&quot;1234&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1235&quot; data-end=&quot;1476&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1235&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1237&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6000 (high of swing area), 0.6028 (2024 high)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1300&quot; data-end=&quot;1368&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1302&quot; data-end=&quot;1368&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5979 (low of swing area) then 0.5949 â€“ 0.5953 (cluster of moving averages including 100 hour, 100 bar on the 4 hour chart, and 200 hour moving averages)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1369&quot; data-end=&quot;1476&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1371&quot; data-end=&quot;1476&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bullish above moving averages a breakout above 0.6000 and the high for the year strengthens the upside case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Pamela comes in at 17494131&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1100&quot; data-end=&quot;1377&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite today&apos;s pullback, the bounce off these key hourly moving averages shows that dip buyers remain active. The 50-hour MAs now serve as key short-term risk levels for both indices. A sustained break below would shift near-term momentum more clearly to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech sector is navigating choppy waters today, with major players showing mixed results. Microsoft (MSFT) slipped slightly at -0.34%, while Nvidia (NVDA), a significant semiconductor stock, declined by 1.01%. The semiconductor segment overall continues to struggle, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropping 1.64%. The technology sectorâ€™s volatility suggests cautious investor sentiment towards impending tech earnings and regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, the energy sector is seeing a wave of green. ExxonMobil (XOM) soared by 1.55%, demonstrating robust investor confidence, likely fueled by climbing oil prices. Chevron (CVX) also appreciated by 0.59%, highlighting energy&apos;s current market momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s market sentiment reflects a shift towards defensive investments. The technology sector&apos;s persistent volatility indicates underlying investor anxiety, possibly linked to recent tech earnings forecasts and broader market uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthcare sector faced significant pressure, with Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbling 2.79% and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) plunging 11.64%. This downturn may be driven by recent regulatory developments affecting drug pricing or recent clinical trial outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cautious investors: Consider reallocating portfolio weights towards stable energy stocks like XOM or CVX, which are positioned to benefit from current commodity price movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For risk-tolerant investors: Monitor tech stocks closely. Select undervalued opportunities post-earnings season may arise, specifically in semiconductor stocks like NVDA and AMD, once market sentiment stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while health sector volatility is pronounced, investors with a long-term horizon might explore companies engaged in critical research that are temporarily facing headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the market is a patchwork of reds and greens today, with significant sectoral divergences underscoring the complexity of current investment landscapes. Investors should stay vigilant and informed, adapting to emerging trends and maintaining diversified portfolios to navigate the ongoing market shifts. ðŸ“Š For real-time market insights, stay connected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;81&quot; data-end=&quot;356&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD continues to exhibit a bullish bias after climbing to its highest level since early December 2024. Buyers have kept the pair supported above the key swing area between 0.6429 and 0.6444 as well as the 100-hour moving average, currently near 0.6430.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;358&quot; data-end=&quot;762&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That swing area, which previously acted as strong resistance (see green numbered circles), has now flipped to support. Price action above this zone reflects a positive shift in sentiment. Just above, the pair has been fluctuating around the 200-day moving average at 0.6461, suggesting some buyer hesitation. Still, the recent move back above this level leans the bias more firmly in favor of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;764&quot; data-end=&quot;982&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Holding above both the 200-day MA and the swing area keeps the bullish structure intact. A break above the recent high near 0.6493 would clear the path for a push toward additional resistance levels from late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;984&quot; data-end=&quot;1161&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, a move back below the 200-day MA, followed by a drop through 0.6429â€“0.6444, would weaken the bullish outlook and likely invite further selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;120&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance Targets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;121&quot; data-end=&quot;326&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;121&quot; data-end=&quot;183&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;123&quot; data-end=&quot;183&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.6461 â€“ 200-day moving average (currently being broken)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;184&quot; data-end=&quot;249&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;186&quot; data-end=&quot;249&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.6493 â€“ High from yesterday / highest level since Dec 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;250&quot; data-end=&quot;326&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;252&quot; data-end=&quot;326&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.6500+ â€“ Opens the door even further above the natural resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;328&quot; data-end=&quot;352&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support Targets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;353&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;353&quot; data-end=&quot;413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;355&quot; data-end=&quot;413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.6444â€“0.6429 â€“ Key swing area (now acting as support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;414&quot; data-end=&quot;452&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;416&quot; data-end=&quot;452&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;0.6430 â€“ 100-hour moving average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;453&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;455&quot; data-end=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Below 0.6429 â€“ Bias shifts bearish; opens risk toward broader downside levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Beyonce is on tour but no one seems to care. The tickets are going for $25 and there are plenty of empty seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, people don&apos;t want to see the same old song and dance anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s increasingly the case with Trump&apos;s trade team talking up trade deals that never seem to materialize. Hassett &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/hassett-on-tariffs-im-sure-there-will-be-news-by-the-end-of-the-day-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on Thursday that a deal was coming later that day and we&apos;re still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Bessent is playing the classics again:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many trading partners have approached us with very good offers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US negotiating with 17 trading partners&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have not engaged with China yet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would think that perhaps as early as this week, we will be announcing trade deals with some of our largest trading partners,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market rallied for 9 days in a row on the hope/expectation that Trump would start to announce trade deals but the clock keeps ticking and yesterday we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-focus-is-back-on-trade-today-in-more-ways-than-one-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;learned &lt;/a&gt;that the US isn&apos;t going to offer zero tariffs, at least to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar is sagging today and gold is up $51 in a troubling potential return of the early-April paradigm. That said, US equities seem to be trying to rally on it once again.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The German political drama of the day is over as Merz was confirmed as Chancellor in the second anonymous vote.  His coalition held a 12-seat majority in the first vote but a dozen parliamentarians decided to cast protest votes before falling in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro touched the highs of the day but it was fleeting as this was expected.&lt;/p&gt;

In the previous two attempts, the pair posted modest gains before retreating, so a sustained move above this level would be a more convincing bullish signal from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;467&quot; data-end=&quot;682&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the pair fails to hold above the 200-hour MA, focus shifts back to the 100-hour moving average at 1.13296.

                            &lt;p&gt;Oil has closed the opening gap for the week and is now up $2.01 to $59.13. It&apos;s an unlikely rebound after OPEC+ added barrels once again on the weekend and a leak said they will continue to do so until Kazakhstan and Iraq meet their pledges to pay back overproduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is an element of short-covering at the moment but yesterday&apos;s report from shale driller Diamondback Energy highlights the likelihood of US output falling this year (and continuing to fall sub-$60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company cut its capex budget for the year by 10% and CEO Travis Stice penned a letter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are taking our foot off the accelerator as we approach a red light. 
If the light turns green before we get to the stoplight, we will hit the
 gas again, but we are also prepared to brake if needed,&quot; Stice wrote, highlighting that it needs to see $65 oil, particularly with steel tariffs spiking the price of casing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimates the US frac crew count is down 15% this year and expected to decline further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is likely that US onshore production has peaked,&quot; he said in a sharp rebuke to &apos;drill, baby, drill&apos; talk of the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big kicker is that US Tier 1 inventory is drying up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, geologic headwinds outweigh the tailwinds provided by improvements in technology and operational efficiency,&quot; Stice wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At oil below $70, those headwinds won&apos;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;179&quot; data-end=&quot;437&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD continues to grind lower, posting a series of lower lows over the last 13 days, but downside momentum remains limited. The pair has been largely contained within a broad consolidation range, with the lower boundary near 1.3759 and resistance capped near 1.3904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;439&quot; data-end=&quot;746&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;More recent attempts by buyers to push the price above the 200-hour moving average (green line currently near 1.38346) have failed, reinforcing that moving averageâ€”as well as the nearby 100-hour MA at 1.38148â€”as interim resistance. The inability to break these levels over the last few days, signals that buyers are still lacking conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;748&quot; data-end=&quot;960&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overhead (on a break of the 200-hour MA), a firm ceiling between 1.3892 and 1.3904 has rejected rallies multiple times over the past few weeks. A break above that zone would be needed to shift the medium-term bias more favorably for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;962&quot; data-end=&quot;1154&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, while the pair has marked incremental new lows, momentum has been shallow. Support remains near 1.3759, and a break below could open up further downside probing as the pair trades at the lowest level going back to October 2024. The 61.8% of the range since the September 2024 low closing at 1.37415. Getting below that retracement level would be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1186&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1187&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1189&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.38148 (100-hour MA), 1.38346 (200-hour MA), 1.3892â€“1.3904 (swing area forming ceiling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1263&quot; data-end=&quot;1292&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1265&quot; data-end=&quot;1292&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3759 - 1.3781 (lows going back to April 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1293&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1295&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish tilt while below moving averages, but lacking strong downside momentum until a break and staying below 2024 lows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;166&quot; data-end=&quot;421&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF has been trading in a sideways range for the past 10 days, confined within a Red Box defined by support at 0.8195 and resistance at 0.8333. This consolidation reflects market indecision, as traders await a breakout for directional clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;423&quot; data-end=&quot;805&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The latest price action shows the pair testing the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, currently converged between 0.8255 and 0.8259. These levels are acting as short-term resistance. A sustained move above would tilt the bias modestly higher and expose the top of the consolidation zone near 0.8333. Beyond that, the 38.2% retracement of the move down from the March 31 high comes in at 0.83505&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;807&quot; data-end=&quot;989&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, failure to hold above the moving averages could see the pair rotate back toward the lower bound of the range near 0.8195, with further support around a swing area between 0.8097 and 0.81288 of the low price from 2024 and 0.80389. That is also the low price going back to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;996&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1024&quot; data-end=&quot;1088&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8259 (100/200-hour MAs), 0.8318 to 0.8333 (swing high area of the consolidation range)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1089&quot; data-end=&quot;1130&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1130&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8195 to 0.8212 (swing area at the low of the red box)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1131&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1133&quot; data-end=&quot;1196&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Modest negative below the 100/200 hour moving averages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Over the past several trading days, the pair repeatedly tested the 1.3259â€“1.32735 region (marked with red numbered circles on the chart) and held, forming a solid floor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Todayâ€™s price action shows a decisive rebound above the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart (blue line, currently at 1.3303)  The break above these levels adds to bullish sentiment and shifts the near-term bias to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;778&quot; data-end=&quot;1031&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next key hurdle was then broken at the resistance swing area between 1.3362 and 1.3378. With the break, it opens the door for a retest of the yearâ€™s high at 1.3441. The 2024 high from September was just below that level at 1.3433.  Earlier highs from Arpil reached up to 1.3423 making the 1.3423 to 1.34413 a key area to get to and through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1033&quot; data-end=&quot;1057&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support now comes in at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1084&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1060&quot; data-end=&quot;1084&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3361 (low of swing area just broken. )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1085&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1087&quot; data-end=&quot;1111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3303 (100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1112&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1114&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3259â€“1.3274 (tested four times and held forming a floor over the last week or so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1162&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move back below the 1.3259 level would invalidate the bullish bias and target the next downside swing zone near 1.3201, with further support at 1.3160 (38.2% retracement of the April move).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;When Trump was elected, one of the most-predictable outcomes was a resumption of steel and aluminum tariffs. This chart shows imports of &apos;finished metal shapes&apos;, which is the official way of saying &apos;things made out of metal&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That points to a $78 billion excess build-up in US metals imports that will slowly be exhausted. How slowly? At the pre-2025 pace of imports of pre-tariffs of $3.48 billion, it will take 22 months to exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US continues to tease a big trade deal and it&apos;s likely with India, but after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/hassett-on-tariffs-im-sure-there-will-be-news-by-the-end-of-the-day-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;saying &lt;/a&gt;on Thursday that it was coming later that day, the deal still hasn&apos;t been struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the UK just appears to have concluded negotiations with India at the same time. India Prime Minister Modi said they have successfully concluded a mutually beneficial trade agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Crude Oil Futures Analysis for Today: Sellers Taking Control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearish Momentum IntensifiesCrude oil futures are showing increased bearish momentum today after clear rejection at yesterday&apos;s Value Area High (VAH) of 58.86. Order flow data indicates significant weakening of buyer strength and increasing seller pressure, particularly noted by negative delta shifts in recent trading sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Technical Insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejection at 58.86 Resistance: Sellers have successfully defended this crucial resistance, signaling potential bearish continuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Order Flow Weakness: Buyer activity has noticeably faded, confirmed by declining buy volume and negative delta percentages, suggesting institutional selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential Downside Targets for Short Sellers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Target:57.57 â€“ Immediate support zone, potential partial profit-taking area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Target:57.19 â€“ Key intraday pivot, further selling could accelerate upon breaking this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Target:56.91 â€“ Volume-based support, possible short-term reversal or consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Target:56.69 â€“ Lower boundary of recent trading range, major target for shorts if bearish momentum persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trader Guidance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor price behavior closely around these outlined targets. Confirmation of continued bearish order flow, such as sustained negative delta and increasing sell volume, would validate the potential for deeper moves lower. Conversely, a sharp reversal or strong buying absorption at any of these levels would signal caution for short positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade at your own risk and ensure disciplined risk management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Where are the US red lines on trade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the big question that needs an answer for me to have any kind of conviction in the macro outlook. Yesterday Kyodo &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/05/7f50bb4801c0-update1-us-rejects-japans-exemption-from-reciprocal-tariffs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Japan&apos;s 
top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa in their meeting in Washington last week 
that the administration of President Donald Trump intends to put only a 
cut in the 14 percent country-specific tariff, suspended through early 
July, on the negotiating table, the sources said&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a big problem for Japan and the rest of the world. If the US is putting a floor on 10% tariffs then we&apos;re in for a bruising trade war. I just can&apos;t see many countries conceding anything if the US isn&apos;t aiming for free trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I fear that Trump wants these negotiations to fail so he can put on tariffs. Maybe that sets up a showdown with Congress that restores order but that&apos;s a hard bet to make at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we get US and Canadian trade balance numbers today for March. At 11:30 pm ET, Carney will arrive to meet Trump and the pair will have a meeting 15 minutes later and then lunch at 12:15 pm ET. It&apos;s not clear when they will address the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the trade data, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to be a market mover.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is moving lower vs. the major currencies. The FOMC rate decision is still one day away where they market traders will be interested in what the Fed has to say about future policy action. For today what technical levels are being broken from the USD selling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD:
Sellers emerged early in the Asian session, but once again, buyers stepped in near 1.1273â€”a key support level on the daily chart. The repeated defense of this level pushed the pair higher, but gains stalled near the 200-hour moving average at 1.13469. That moving average has capped rallies over the past two days, each time leading to a reversal. Today, sellers appear more cautious. A sustained move above the 200-hour moving average would shift the technical bias more firmly to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY:
Last Friday, USDJPY tested the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, where sellers stepped in and drove the pair lower. In todayâ€™s session, the price first broke below the 200-hour moving average and then found temporary support at the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart near 142.86. However, sellers have since pushed the price below that level as the U.S. session gets underway. Holding below the 100-bar moving average would open the door toward the next downside target in the 141.64â€“142.11 swing area. On the flip side, a failure to stay below could lead to a rebound toward the 200-hour moving average at 143.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD:
GBPUSD is pushing higher today after breaking above the 100-hour moving average at 1.3302, followed by the 200-hour moving average at 1.3326. The bullish momentum has taken the pair into a key resistance zone between 1.3362 and 1.3378. The current price is trading within that swing area. A break above would open the door toward the upper extreme for the year, between 1.3378 and 1.3441.
