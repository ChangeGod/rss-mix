                            &lt;p&gt;There was so much noise over the weekend and yesterday about the Moody&apos;s downgrade with even some doomsday scenarios. I&apos;ve argued (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-30-year-treasury-yield-rises-to-5-for-the-first-time-since-april-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that it was no big deal and just a symbolic thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the US30Y chart now, the market erased the entire rise and we are basically back to where we were before the downgrade. We can now go back to focus on what really matters, which is future Fed policy and inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-wants-lower-interest-rates-but-hes-strategy-is-likely-to-lead-to-higher-rates-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
 there&apos;s limited downside at the moment for yields and the path of least
 resistance remains to the upside as inflation risk increases. In fact, 
as we now price in better and better conditions for growth, the economic
 activity will 
likely start to accelerate and that could lead to inflationary 
pressures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is also in a difficult position because rate cuts now
 could exacerbate inflation fears and drive long term yields even 
higher. That&apos;s what will drive the bond market in the next months. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some members said JGB market functionality improving as a trend due to BoJ&apos;s taper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other participants said there is distortion between super-long yields and yields for other maturities due to dwindling liquidity in super-long JGB market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some market participants called for faster pace of BoJ taper from fiscal 2026 though others called for maintaining or slowing pace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions from market players included those wanting new taper plan to cover about two years, and others saying BoJ should lay out a 1-year plan then maintain that taper level thereafter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions by market players on monthly BoJ bond buying amount at the end of new taper period ranged from zero, 1-2 trillion yen, and about 3 trillion yen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions by market players included one calling for nimble response to sharp decline in liquidity for super-long JGBs such as termination of taper or increase in BoJ&apos;s purchase amount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others said worsening supply-demand for super-long JGBs is due to structural factor such as lack of investor demand, and not something BoJ can fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s long end yields continue to increase pretty fast, with the 30yr hitting the highest on record after the auction of 20-year bonds got the lowest demand since 2012. Here market participants lay out a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinflation is on track, but new shocks are posing new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs may be disinflationary in the short run but pose upside risks over the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appreciation of the Euro is historical opportunity to foster the international role of the Euro.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s nothing new here but I agree that tariffs are disinflationary in the short term given the negative demand shock but it could indeed pose upside risk on inflation going forward especially if you get the reversal in policies like we&apos;ve seen with Trump and therefore potential pick up in economic activity as uncertainty eases.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the main event was the RBA policy decision. The central bank cut interest rates by 25 bps as expected but delivered some dovish messages. The RBA emphasised growth risk caused by trade policies and revised growth and inflation forecasts lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AUD got pushed lower after the release but started to recover most of the losses before RBA&apos;s Govenor Bullock mentioned that they did discuss a 50 bps cut. That pushed the Aussie dollar to new lows before another bounce as the following comments struck a more neutral tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the Canadian CPI report where the Trimmed Mean Y/Y is expected at 2.9% vs. 2.8% prior and the Median Y/Y is seen at 2.9% vs. 2.9% prior. The market is pricing a 62% chance of a 25 bps cut at the upcoming meeting and a total of 47 bps of easing by year-end. A higher than expected reading could see the market put aside a rate cut at the upcoming meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also have some more Fedspeak and the focus will be on potential hawkish comments as the market is now back at pricing just two rate cuts in 2025. From now on, we will either price in more cuts or less cuts than expected and that will move markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;08:00 GMT/04:00 ET - BoE&apos;s Pill (hawk - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:00 GMT/06:00 ET - ECB&apos;s Cipollone (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:00 GMT/06:00 ET - ECB&apos;s Knot (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:00 GMT/09:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Bostic (hawk - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:00 GMT/09:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Barkin (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:30 GMT/09:30 ET - Fed&apos;s Collins (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17:00 GMT/13:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Musalem (hawk - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21:00 GMT/17:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Kugler (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23:00 GMT/19:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Daly (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

 producer prices in April 2025. By contrast, non-durable and durable 
consumer goods, capital goods and intermediate goods were more expensive
 than in the same month of the previous year. When energy prices are 
excluded, producer prices in April 2025 were up 1.5% on April 2024 and 
increased by 0.4% compared with March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The AUD falls on more dovish RBA forecasts</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The AUD is lower across the board following the RBA decision. The statement was basically the same of what we&apos;ve got in April although there&apos;s more emphasis on trade policies risk. What weighed on the Aussie dollar was the negative revision in growth and inflation forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 2.0% in June 2025, 2.3% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.7% in June 2025, 2.7% in June 2026 and 2.7% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is no big deal because forecasts can change and the central banks have no conviction on what&apos;s next for policy and so on. My expectation is that we will have a rebound in growth and that would place upward pressure on inflation considering the recent rate cuts and fiscal boosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would expect the central banks, including the RBA to deliver less rate cuts than currently priced in. So I would fade this reaction in the AUD, especially versus other currencies because I&apos;m still a bit bullish on the USD until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a nice support zone around the 0.6350 level on AUDUSD. Of course the pair is 80% driven by the USD, so the US macro factors are more influential, but if the sellers manage to extend the pullback, the support zone could be a nice spot where the buyers can look for dip buying opportunities. A break lower though, should open the door for the 0.60 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;

						changing rapidly, thereby making the central forecasts subject to considerable uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private domestic demand appears to have been recovering, real
						household incomes have picked up and there has been an easing in some measures of financial stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A range of indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain tight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
						domestic and international developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board judged that the risks to inflation have become more balanced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation is in the target band
						and upside risks appear to have diminished as international developments are expected to weigh on the
						economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With inflation expected to remain around target, the Board therefore judged that an easing in
						monetary policy at this meeting was appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board assesses that this move will make monetary
						policy somewhat less restrictive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board considered a severe
						downside scenario and noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international
						developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
						doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
						in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, this is what I anticipated in the &quot;heads up&quot; article. The RBA lowered the cash rate as an acknowledgement of inflation progress but remains cautious on the future outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank emphasised the risks around trade policies though and the potential drag on growth. That&apos;s why it has cut growth and inflation forecasts, which is what is weighing on the AUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP Growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unemployment seen at 4.2% in June 2025, 4.3% in June 2026 and 4.3% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cash rate assumed at 4.0% in June 2025, 3.2% in June 2026 and 3.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2025/mr-25-13.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its cash rate target by 25 bps bringing it to 3.85% vs 4.10% prior. Focus will be on macro forecasts and forward guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the RBA will keep its neutral stance as it lowers the cash rate just as acknowledgement of inflation progress and as an &quot;insurance&quot; for some potential slowdown given the recent economic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

Kato said he would stress the need to avoid excessive currency volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the yen, major FX was fairly subdued with minor shifts only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;786&quot; data-end=&quot;995&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;PBoC cuts LPRs by 10bps in measured easing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;786&quot; data-end=&quot;995&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Knot seems the most likely to be making comments pertinent to traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All times listed below are GMT/US Eastern time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1000/0600		Pre-recorded video interview with ECB board member Piero Cipollone during AsVis Sustainable Development Festival&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1000/0600		ECB policy maker Klaas Knot speaks at a press conference at the Dutch central bank&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also speaking, but likely not on monetary policy matters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0955/0555		Participation by ECB board member Sharon Donnery in fireside chat at BPFI National Banking Conference in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1150/0750		ECB supervisor Claudia Buch speaks at The Association for Financial Markets in Europe’s 5th Annual European Financial Integration Conference in Frankfurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Opposition coalition splits. Nationals withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Party leader Littleproud:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ending coalition with the Liberal Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Party will sit alone on a principled basis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will work constructively with the Liberal Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post for the locals here in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those not in Australia, the Nationals and Liberals have been in coalition for almost forever. Also, the &apos;Liberals&apos; here in Australia are the Conservative side of politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia is currently governed by the Labor Party, the non-conservative side of politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all a simplification. But if you want more politics detail I&apos;m not your man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L to R: Prime Minister Albanese (Labor) and Dutton. Dutton was leader of the losing Liberal Party. Dutton lost his seat in parliament and his Liberal Party suffered a huge defeat. Coalition Nationals did not fare as badly, its little wonder they&apos;ve pulled the pin on the partnership. My tip is they&apos;ll join forces soon enough once the Liberals get their act together under the new leader. &lt;/p&gt;

The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous close was 7.2155&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBOC injected 357bn yuan via 7-day reverse repos at 1.40%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;180bn yuan matured today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;net injection 177bn yuan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>PBOC cuts Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) by 10bp for both 1- and 5-year loans</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The cuts were expected.  The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said that 10 basis point cut would lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivered today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPRs are no longer as important as they once were. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC) shifted its primary monetary policy tool to the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) rate. This transition began in mid-2024. This move aligns China&apos;s monetary policy framework more closely with global standards, such as those of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which typically rely on a single short-term policy rate to guide market expectations and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) 🚨 RECESSION RISK DROPS—BUT DIMON WARNS: “DON’T GET COMFORTABLE”

Kalshi now sees just a 38% chance of a U.S. recession this year, a sharp drop that suggests rising investor confidence. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has a stark warning: “Severe stagflation is still on the table.”

At JPM’s investor day, Dimon cautioned that a toxic mix of inflation and recession could still hit the U.S. economy hard—bringing deep credit losses and sharper revenue declines than many expect. He pointed to 15 years of overly generous lending and rising geopolitical risks as serious threats.
