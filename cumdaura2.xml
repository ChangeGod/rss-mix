                            &lt;p&gt;The Taiwanewse dollar has rocketed higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is reigniting specualtion that some Asian countries are planning to revaule their currencies as a move to gain concession from the US on tariffs (a higher currency makes a country&apos;s exports more expensive, at the margin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD is lower across the board today. Including against the Chinese yuan. While China is on holiday today offshore yuan, of course, continues to trade. The Hong Kong dollar tested the strong end of its allowable trading band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/TWD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/CNH is circa 7.1963&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve posted a little on the Australian election, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
governing Labor Party won with an increased majority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;won 85 seats (76 required for a majority) compared with 77 in 2022&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;opposition centre-right coalition at least
39 seats, 18 fewer than in 2022 - Opposition leader Peter
Dutton lost his seat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16 seats still too close to call&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labor now the
largest party in the Senate, will hold at least 28 seats, up from 26&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Coalition
is likely to have 26 seats, down from 32&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greens likely to
hold the balance of power in the upper chamber with 11 seats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore went to the polls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ruling
People&apos;s Action Party won its fourth consecutive election&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PAP now has 87 of the 97 seats up for contest &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;hard-right&quot; (pundit desciption) candidate George Simion is leading the presidential election with 40% of the vote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Centrists Nicușor Dan in second place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With no candidate projected to get more than 50% of the vote, a run-off between the top two is expected on 18 May.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

I think they can have three dolls or four dolls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It also pointed to increasing reliance on a few major third-party AI providers, which could lead to market concentration, new contagion risks, and greater vulnerability to cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;721&quot; data-end=&quot;918&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite these risks, the central bank acknowledged that AI offers clear benefits, including increased productivity, more accurate modelling, improved risk assessment, and enhanced cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;920&quot; data-end=&quot;1238&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kerry Watt, RBNZ’s director of financial stability assessment and strategy, underscored the need for vigilance: “There is considerable uncertainty around how AI will shape the financial system. We will continue to closely monitor developments … to ensure the system remains well-positioned to manage emerging risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;589&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Wall Street Journal op-ed from US Treasury Secretary Bessent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;589&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It ostensibly outlines the economic vision as a revival plan for America’s working class but reads more like campaign rhetoric than grounded policy. Framed as a moral reckoning with the past failures of globalization, it blames neoliberal trade policies—particularly China’s WTO entry—for decades of American decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;591&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The article presents Trump’s economic agenda as a three-pronged strategy: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;renegotiated trade via tariffs, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;permanent tax cuts, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and sweeping deregulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;591&quot; data-end=&quot;943&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet it glosses over the known downsides of tariffs (consumer price hikes), omits how tax cuts have ballooned the deficit, and offers little evidence deregulation alone can rebuild U.S. manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;945&quot; data-end=&quot;1319&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The plan hinges on restoring “economic security” through tariffs and tax breaks, but it assumes without much proof that these will magically reindustrialize the economy and raise wages. The claim that “we need government to get out of the way” ignores the complex role federal support has historically played in building industrial capacity—particularly in tech and defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1321&quot; data-end=&quot;1648&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps most questionable is the implication that Trump’s policies are already working. The op-ed cites a few months of jobs data and lower inflation as signs of momentum, despite widespread consensus that macroeconomic trends are shaped by longer-term dynamics, including Fed policy and global conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1650&quot; data-end=&quot;2112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the end, the piece offers an ideological blueprint heavy on slogans—“energy dominance,” “economic security is national security,” “Main Street and Wall Street rising together”—but light on credible data or acknowledgment of trade-offs. It to be not much more than a campaign-era remix of 2017-style trickle-down economics wrapped in industrial nationalist branding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1650&quot; data-end=&quot;2112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1650&quot; data-end=&quot;2112&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Journal is gated,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-three-steps-to-economic-growth-tariffs-trade-tax-cuts-deregulation-7804053a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; here is the link i&lt;/a&gt;f you want and can access it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OPEC+ to accelerate oil output hikes, warns of ending voluntary cuts if compliance lags</title>

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;313&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reuters conveying the information that OPEC+ is preparing to fast-track oil output hikes through October and may scrap 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of voluntary production cuts by November if member compliance does not improve. Reuters cite according to five sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;315&quot; data-end=&quot;719&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The decision follows April&apos;s surprise move to raise output faster than expected, a strategy reportedly led by Saudi Arabia to penalise members falling short of their quotas. A fresh increase for June was agreed over the weekend, pushing total planned hikes from April to June to nearly 1 million bpd. Another 411,000 bpd is expected to be approved for July, with further increases likely through October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;721&quot; data-end=&quot;879&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The market will take this news negatively, as long as crude exports do not suggest improved compliance within OPEC+,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;881&quot; data-end=&quot;1093&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia also issued a warning on non-compliance during the latest meeting, one source said. Kazakhstan has already openly defied the group, with its energy minister saying national interests take precedence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1095&quot; data-end=&quot;1298&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If laggards like Iraq and Kazakhstan fail to compensate for overproduction, the group could fully unwind the voluntary cuts — originally planned to remain in place until late 2026 — as early as November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1095&quot; data-end=&quot;1298&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1095&quot; data-end=&quot;1298&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Oil futures trade begins soon, update as of Friday; &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;67&quot; data-end=&quot;235&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland, calling the territory vital for American security interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;237&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything,” Trump said in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. “We need Greenland very badly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;426&quot; data-end=&quot;712&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Greenland, the world’s largest island and an autonomous territory of Denmark — a NATO ally — has long been on Trump’s radar. Since taking office, he has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring the island, raising alarm in diplomatic circles and triggering backlash in Greenland itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;714&quot; data-end=&quot;971&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trump described Greenland as “a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them,” emphasizing its strategic importance for defense and future access to mineral resources. “We need that for international security,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;973&quot; data-end=&quot;1133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;His remarks are likely to stoke fresh tensions with Denmark and NATO partners concerned about U.S. expansionism and the use of force against allied territories. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Japan (further) walks back Treasury threat, says no plan to use holdings as trade leverage</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;I posted the threat from Japan&apos;s finance minister Kato back on Friday. Kato had raised eyebrows by suggesting that Japan’s massive holdings — more than $1 trillion and the largest globally — could be “a card” in trade talks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-fin-min-kato-said-had-no-discussion-at-all-with-us-of-where-yen-fx-level-should-be-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; Japan&apos;s huge US Treasury holdings among tools it can wield in trade negotiations with the US, then adds whether Japan wields that card is a different question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big threat and Kato watered it down as soon as the words left his gob:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japans-us-treasury-holdings-among-tools-for-trade-talks-finance-minister-kato-says-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;&quot;Whether we actually use that card, however, is a different question.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further dialled it back over the weekend. Kato said Sunday the country has no intention of threatening to sell its U.S. Treasury holdings in trade talks with Washington, softening earlier remarks that hinted otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“The comments weren’t meant to suggest selling Treasury holdings,” Kato told reporters in Milan, explaining that his earlier statement was in response to a hypothetical about reassuring the U.S. such sales wouldn’t happen easily. He clarified, “We don’t plan to use sale of U.S. Treasury holdings as a bargaining tool in the negotiations.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kato reiterated the primary purpose of the holdings is to ensure liquidity for potential yen intervention: “This has been our stance.”

Kato added that “whether Japan actually uses that card is a different question,” underscoring that the reference was theoretical, not a policy signal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;USD/JPY update as trade kicks off for the week:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt; The Financial Times reports that Chinese exporters are &apos;washing&apos; their products by shipping them via third countries to &apos;conceal their true origin&apos; and avoid tariffs imposed by Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a well-known practice, but the FT is bringing it more mainstream notice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial Times front page report:&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;99&quot; data-end=&quot;444&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trump has ruled out removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite continuing to criticise him and urge for rate cuts. Speaking to NBC&apos;s Meet the Press, Trump said, “No, no, no. That was a total – why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;446&quot; data-end=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While calling Powell “a total stiff” and claiming the Fed chief “just doesn’t like me,” Trump reiterated his belief that the central bank should cut interest rates, saying, “At some point, he will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;652&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The interview marks Trump’s clearest signal yet that Powell’s job is safe for now, after earlier market jitters over the Fed’s independence sparked by Trump’s attacks last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;652&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1080&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Separately, on trade, Trump defended his sweeping tariff actions, saying the U.S. had gone “cold turkey” on China, effectively halting trade. He added, “They want to make a deal very badly. We’ll see how that all turns out, but it’s got to be a fair deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1082&quot; data-end=&quot;1290&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Asked whether tariffs might remain in place permanently, Trump replied: “No, I wouldn’t do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1292&quot; data-end=&quot;1452&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trump’s administration is currently negotiating with more than 15 countries to try to finalise trade agreements that could delay or reduce planned tariff hikes. Playing chicken with firms considering building in the US doesn&apos;t seem to be responsible political leadership, but that&apos;s what employers are dealing with there. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The data from Australia and Singapore is marked as lower-tier only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the Australian PMIs are not sponsored by Judo Bank any more, they are the S&amp;amp;P Global PMIs for now. Last week we got the final manufacturing PMI for April:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-sp-global-pmi-manufacturing-april-2025-final-517-prior-521-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Australia S&amp;amp;P Global PMI Manufacturing April 2025, final 51.7 (prior 52.1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it&apos;s the Services and Composite PMIs for that month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TD-MI Inflation Gauge listed is a privately surveyed CPI measure. It can be a little volatile and have divergence from the official monthly CPI, but it&apos;s a useful first look and the month&apos;s price pressures. Its probably not going to be too much of a focus today, Australia is digesting the re-election of the incumbent government with a bigger majority. Pundits are calling it a &apos;landslide&apos; victory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via BBC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Albanese&apos;s centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted &quot;full responsibility&quot; for his party&apos;s loss and apologised to his MPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition leader Dutton was compared to Trump by many in Australia during the election campaign, an accusation he had trouble shaking off. He has done so now, though, taking responsibility for the loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUD/USD is showing circa 0.6441 in VERY early trade, little changed from its NY closing level on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/p&gt;
