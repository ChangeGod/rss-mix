                            &lt;p&gt;Despite a jobs report that means (according to WSJ Timiraos, that the &quot;Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&quot; and &quot;makes a June rate cut less likely&quot;, the USD is moving lower with the USDCAD extending to new lows for the year and the lowest level for the year and going back to October 2024.  Reports that Canada PM may be hopeful of a deal for Canada sooner rather than later (or maybe not?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;220&quot; data-end=&quot;515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the USDCAD tried to rebound earlier today but ran into stiff resistance near the 100-hour (1.3825) and 200-hour (1.3842) moving averages, which capped the upside. The high price reached 1.3837—just below the 200-hour MA—before sellers took control and pushed the pair back lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, support has reemerged near the April low and red-box consolidation floor at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the pair broke briefly below this level to a new cycle low of 1.3769, but momentum faded and buyers stepped in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both those targets have now been breached today with the pair reaching another  new low for the day and going back to October 2024 at 1.37638. Not all that convincing, but If the corrective rally can be limited, a new push could be made with more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, for those not jumping on the sell the USD, the failed break gives the dip buyers a new low to lean against. If the price moves below, get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, however, the sellers are more in control. The price highs today stalled at the MAs - Bearish. A new low was made - Bearish. The price is trading new lows going back to October - Bearish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;826&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So if buying, understand that you are swimming against that tide. Understand the risk. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;At this time yesterday on CNBC, here is what White House Economic Advisor Kevin Hassett said when asked about a trade deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&apos;d like the person in the middle of all that is Jamieson Greer and
 Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to 
you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess he didn&apos;t know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected this would be India and that can still come today but the US dollar weakness today may be partly on trade disappointment and the harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments &lt;/a&gt;that came from Japan today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) $AMZN - JEFF BEZOS FILES TO SELL UP TO $5B IN AMAZON STOCK

Bezos, whose net worth is valued at over $200 billion, will sell up to 25 million shares in the company, valued at around $5 billion, Amazon disclosed in a regulatory filing Friday. The value of the shares could change, of course, depending on Amazon’s stock price. If it declines, they would be worth less, if it rises, they would be worth more.

                            &lt;p&gt;The market has taken down the implied probability of a June rate cut from upwards of 75% last week down to 42% at present. The latest leg in the shift came after a solid but unspectacular non-farm payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Timiraos from the WSJ highlights the Fed&apos;s view:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The April jobs report makes a June rate cut less likely (even though that is a world away) because there will only be one more employment report before then.

For now, it means the Fed doesn&apos;t have to say anything on June at next week&apos;s meeting&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year ahead, the market is now pricing in 111 bps in easing, about 20 basis points below what it was pricing last week. The combination of this data, GDP, ISM manufacturing, PCE data and corporate comments about consumer spending (especially Visa) has the market feeling good about the state of the economy -- or at least the state of the economy heading into the tariff war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all makes me wonder: Where would the market be right now without the tariffs? Inflation falling, the Fed cutting even as economy accelerated and Congress focused on the tax package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) STEADY HIRING IN APRIL WILL REINFORCE FED&apos;S &quot;PATIENT&quot; STANCE -- NICK TIMIRAOS

     Federal Reserve officials have broadly indicated that interest-rate cuts will likely require clear signs of rising unemployment.
     Because April&apos;s employment report offers very few indications of a broad-based decline in hiring, Fed officials can easily maintain their wait-and-see posture at their policy meeting next week-including by saying little that would offer any sign the central bank is prepared to lower interest rates at its subsequent meeting in mid-June.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD moved higher but is retracing some of the moves after the US jobs report which came in with the month revisions last month, about expectations.  This month rose 177K vs 130K (+47K), but the prior month was revised to 185K from 228K (-43K). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURUSD: The EURUSD moved to a low of 1.1303 which briefly traded below lows from last week at 1.13072. However, the price is trading back higher and trades at 1.1330 currently. The high today stallled at the 100 hour moving average near 1.13516 currently .  Support 1.1307. Resistance 1.13516 now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY: The USDJPY moved up to 144.95, but is back down trading at 144.55 currently. There is a swing area between 144.45 and 144.55 that if broken would have traders looking toward the broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the March 27 high. That level comes in at 144.208.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBPUSD: The GBPUSD initially moved lower, but found buyers near the low from yesterday and the low for the week at 1.32594. The low price reached 1.3260. The next target on the top side comes in at 1.32922 followed by the high for the day near 1.3320 and the 200 hour moving average of 1.3330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDCAD: The USDCAD moved higher but found a willing seller&apos;s between the 200 hour moving average of 1.3842 and the 100 hour moving average of 1.32295. The high price reached and 1.32378 before rotating back to the downside. If the price is going higher it needs to get and stay above those moving averages. On the downside, the low of the red box consolidation area comes in at 1.3781. On Wednesday, the price moved below that level to a low of 1.3769 but could not sustain momentum and reestablished support against the prior low at 1.3781 before moving higher during yesterday&apos;s trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at US stocks in premarket trading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average up 438 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index up 64.61 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ up 214 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market yields are higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.770%, +6.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5  year yield 3.880%, +6.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.283%, +5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.779%, +4.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Happy Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures are upbeat on the comments from China about trade but I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-negotiators-reportedly-firmly-opposed-to-us-tariffs-proposal-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;comments from Japan &lt;/a&gt;to be the story today, as the US appears &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-reluctant-to-exempt-japan-from-10-reciprocal-tariff-kyodo-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;to be set&lt;/a&gt; on leaving the majority of tariffs on permanently, including the 10% floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the market can turn away from tariffs for a few minutes and focus on the domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AnnaEconomist/status/1918040523249537501&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chart from Anna Wong&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the seasonal trend in leisure and hospitality hiring. Those are two industries that are likely to struggle in the months ahead, along with transport and construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that if today&apos;s report is strong, it will delay the inevitable pain from this later while if it&apos;s weak, then there was softness even ahead of this. I&apos;m not sure I agree but that&apos;s the sentiment that&apos;s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt; B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD is lower vs the major currency pairs - the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD - ahead of the US jobs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectation is for the jobs shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-farm payroll 130K vs 228K last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unemployment rate 4.2% vs 4.2% last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average hourly earnings 0.3% vs 0.3% last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average workweek 34.2 hours vs 34.2 hours last month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers released so far this month:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADP report +62K versus +147K prior (lowest in almost 2 years)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISM services employment not yet released&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISM manufacturing employment 46.5 vs 44.7 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-april-challenger-layoffs-10544k-vs-27524k-prior-20250501/&quot;&gt;Challenger &lt;/a&gt;job cuts 105.44k vs 275.2k prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philly employment +0.2 vs +19.7 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empire employment -2.6 vs -4.1 prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial jobless claims survey week 216K vs 225K prior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonals from BMO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In April, the headline beat 57% of the time and missed 43% of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On unemployment, the rate has been lower than expected 42% of the time, higher 39% of the time and in line 19% of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADP looms large ahead of the report and the recent JOLTS number was soft but the initial jobless claims numbers lately haven&apos;t shown any sign of layoffs, including today&apos;s number which was skewed by New York teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN the video above, I take a look at the technical drivers for each of the major currency pairs ahead of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware. Be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets ahead of the report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is down $0.70 or -1.16% at $58.55&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is trading up $22 or 0.70% at $3261.40&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading at $320 at $96,855&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;in the premarket for US stocks, the US futures are implying a marginally higher opening. The S&amp;amp;P index is up for eight consecutive days:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average +168 points after rising 83.6 points or 0.21% yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index is up 19.36 points after rising 35.08 points or 0.63% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index of 54 points after rising 264.40 points or 1.52% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US that market, yields are mixed with the shorter and marginally higher in the longer an marginally lower: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.716%, +1.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5- year yield 3.819%, +0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.225%, -0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.17 1%, -1.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Microsoft&apos;s Earnings Breakout: The $400 Threshold and Investor Insights</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Round Numbers Matter: Microsoft&apos;s $400 Threshold and What Comes Next&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in tech stocks often focus intensely on financial statements, earnings calls, and analyst forecasts. However, experienced market participants know there&apos;s another vital aspect of trading and investing—psychological price levels, specifically round numbers. Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings-driven surge past the critical $400 threshold provides a compelling case study. But what exactly does this round-number milestone mean for investors, and why should they pay close attention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Psychological Power of Round Numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round numbers, such as $100, $200, $400, or $500, often serve as psychological barriers or support levels. These figures hold emotional significance for traders and investors, influencing buying and selling decisions in ways financial fundamentals alone cannot explain. Microsoft&apos;s decisive move above the $400 mark, propelled by strong earnings fueled by aggressive AI investments, has clear psychological implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s Milestone: Decoding the Market Reaction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft shares surged nearly 8% following robust earnings results, investors quickly noticed the breakout beyond $400, reaching approximately $425. Such breakouts can signal the start of a sustained bullish trend, provided the stock maintains support above this new level. Alternatively, a swift reversal below $400 would signal potential vulnerability and caution investors to reassess their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical Context and Future Projections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, stocks crossing key round-number thresholds often experience heightened volatility shortly after the event, as market participants test the new level’s durability. Investors need to observe Microsoft&apos;s performance in the immediate days and weeks following its breakout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario A: Consolidation and Further Gains
If Microsoft maintains price stability above $400, particularly consolidating near current levels ($425 range), it will indicate sustained market confidence, potentially attracting additional buying pressure. Investors can then anticipate the next psychological target at $450 or even $500 as viable milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario B: Failure and Retest
Conversely, if Microsoft retraces sharply and fails to hold above $400, it could indicate market doubts regarding the sustainability of recent earnings-driven enthusiasm. Such a scenario might trigger a retest of lower support levels, possibly around $380 or $370, creating cautionary signals for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from Market Examples&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Google stock&apos;s journey when it initially breached the $200 per share at the end of 2024 per. This was a psychological barrierfor the stock. The stock experienced intense investor enthusiasm immediately following the breakout, yet volatility remained high. Subsequent trading patterns helped clarify the durability of investor confidence at that critical level, confirmed on 05 Feb 2025 after its earnings report, as the price had its first close under the $200 round number, opening the door for another massive 26% down. While I am not saying that the decline was not driven by other factors, but that this round number, as happens many times, is another psychological trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft investors should similarly watch volatility closely post-breakout. If its future is indeed bright, as shown in this week&apos;s earnings report, it must not even come close to playing with the $400 round number. Being far enough away at $425, that ship has sailed... if, indeed, the future is bright for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round numbers are important junctions that hint about the state of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Strategies: Navigating Psychological Thresholds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should apply disciplined strategies when stocks approach or breach significant round numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor Volume and Volatility: Increased trading volume accompanied by stable or rising prices after crossing a key level indicates robust investor support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assess Fundamental Strength: Validate price moves with ongoing fundamental analysis, ensuring that price action aligns with genuine financial strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk Management: Utilize clear stop-loss and profit-taking strategies around these psychological levels to manage risk effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Why Microsoft&apos;s $400 Milestone Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s breakout above $400 isn&apos;t merely symbolic—it is practically significant. Investors who understand the psychological dynamics surrounding round numbers gain additional tools for informed decision-making. Observing Microsoft&apos;s behavior at this critical juncture can yield valuable insights into the stock&apos;s short- to medium-term trajectory, informing smarter, more strategic investment choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Microsoft&apos;s $400 breakout is an instructive moment for investors, highlighting why paying attention to psychological price levels remains a critical aspect of sophisticated stock market investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert (and just an opinon... Do your own research...): MSFT stock, now at $425 after earnings - in inclined to consolidate a bit but the $440 seems like a legit technical target in the short term.

      <title>Earnings Headlines vs Earnings Price Action</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/stock-market-update/earnings-headlines-vs-earnings-price-action-20250502/</link>

                            &lt;p&gt;Big Tech Earnings: Separating Headlines from Reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When big tech giants like this week&apos;s Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta report earnings, headlines quickly flood the market. These headlines often shape immediate investor sentiment and trading behavior. However, insightful investors understand a crucial truth: Headlines can mislead, and the actual price action provides the ultimate reality check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Real Market Response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s recent earnings serve as a prime example. Despite seemingly solid financial results—5% revenue growth and 12% increase in service revenues—Apple&apos;s stock fell approximately 3% pre-market. Why the disconnect? Investor uncertainty about future quarters and tariff impacts overshadowed strong headline figures. This illustrates why investors must go beyond superficial earnings narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines vs. Price Action: The Case of Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Microsoft&apos;s earnings headlines matched the positive price action, as shares surged nearly 8% following strong revenue gains attributed directly to strategic AI investments. The sustained positive price movement validated investors&apos; optimistic interpretation of Microsoft&apos;s headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Investors Should Prioritize Price Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Sentiment: Price action captures market sentiment comprehensively, reflecting collective investor judgment, including hidden risks or optimistic insights not immediately apparent in headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Validation: Sustained positive or negative price movement after earnings announcements often accurately predicts long-term performance better than short-lived headline-driven volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should adopt a disciplined approach, watching stock performance closely for several days post-earnings rather than reacting impulsively to initial headlines. Stocks maintaining strong positive momentum (like Microsoft and Meta currently exhibit) signal genuine market confidence. Conversely, sustained weakness (as observed recently in Apple and Amazon) indicates deeper investor skepticism or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, wise investors will leverage headlines as initial signals, validating these signals through careful monitoring of subsequent price action. This strategy helps distinguish genuine investment opportunities from transient market noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Cyclical Dilemma: Is AWS at an AI Crossroads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon&apos;s latest earnings report, accompanied by a roughly 2.5% decline in pre-market trading, highlights investor concerns about cyclical pressures and profitability—particularly in its AWS cloud computing division. Amid escalating investments in artificial intelligence (AI), AWS faces critical questions that investors must consider: Will AWS overcome short-term cyclical headwinds, or is it at a crossroads that might redefine its future profitability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Profitability Pressures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS has historically been a primary profit driver for Amazon, often subsidizing investments into other segments, including e-commerce. However, recent earnings indicate rising operating costs and margin pressures, partly due to significant capital expenditure on AI infrastructure. Investors are rightfully concerned whether these costs will yield sustained returns or weigh down profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Amazon’s AI Strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike competitors such as Microsoft, which has rapidly monetized AI through Azure, Amazon has faced challenges demonstrating similar immediate returns from its AI investments. AWS’s expansive AI-related CapEx suggests potential long-term rewards, but investors must weigh these anticipated future benefits against immediate margin pressures and operational risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Insights: Metrics to Watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors focusing on Amazon should closely monitor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Operating Margins: Consistent improvements here could indicate successful AI integration and cost management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue Growth in AWS: Accelerated growth rates could reflect increased demand for AI-powered cloud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CapEx Efficiency: How efficiently Amazon converts its heavy investments into tangible, scalable revenue streams will significantly influence long-term valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Crossroads for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon investors face a strategic decision point. They must assess whether AWS’s current cyclical downturn represents an opportune moment to position for potential future upside or signals deeper structural challenges requiring caution. Investors should critically evaluate quarterly financial performance, particularly AWS-related metrics, as a litmus test of Amazon’s long-term AI strategy viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while AWS remains integral to Amazon’s long-term growth narrative, investors must carefully discern whether current cyclical pressures mask deeper profitability issues or offer a strategic entry point for future growth driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

It is being reported that the US is reluctant to drop the reciprocal 10% tariffs, alongside auto, steel, and aluminum tariffs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s hardly an optimistic sign on how Trump is setting his team to approach negotiations in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, Japan is hitting back at that and saying that they are firmly opposing the US&apos; proposal. Finance minister Kato even went as far as saying that they could even look at the country&apos;s Treasury holdings as &quot;a card&quot; in negotiations, but &quot;whether or not we use that card is a different decision&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The next discussion will only take place after the middle of May. So, that&apos;s the can being kicked down the road for yet another two weeks. So much for quick progress, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The stalemate serves as a warning for other countries as well, with the clock continuing to count down. Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were up 0.8% earlier in the day before paring a chunk of that to be up just 0.2% during the session. Overall, the animal spirits are still holding up but we&apos;ll see if that is enough to keep the win streak going in Wall Street to wrap up the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In FX, the dollar is once again offered amid the less than ideal trade headlines. EUR/USD pushed up above 1.1300 to 1.1340 while USD/JPY is down 0.6% to 144.50 currently, after hanging around 145.20 in the handover from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The euro is also getting some slight help from a hotter-than-expected Eurozone core inflation estimate for April. The jump was largely due to services inflation and that will give the ECB something to think about before the likely next rate cut in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, USD/CHF is also marked down by 0.6% to 0.8238 while AUD/USD is seen up 0.8% to 0.6434 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is up again in a push to $3,260 levels while bond yields are slightly down with 10-year Treasury yields in particular holding just under its 200-day moving average of 4.22% for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s on to the US jobs report next before eyeing more trade/Trump headlines before the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Connection: What Big Tech Earnings Tell Us About AI Demand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent earnings reports from tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon have not only captured investor attention but also provided crucial insights into the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this AI wave is NVIDIA, the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), essential hardware powering AI infrastructure. How might NVIDIA be impacted by the latest signals from big tech earnings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong AI Momentum From Microsoft and Meta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Meta have demonstrated substantial financial returns from their aggressive AI strategies. Microsoft&apos;s integration of OpenAI’s GPT technology into Azure and Meta’s robust AI-driven user engagement metrics suggest rapid growth in enterprise demand for AI capabilities. These developments directly increase the need for NVIDIA’s powerful GPUs, positioning NVIDIA as a significant beneficiary of the current AI expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple and Amazon: More Measured Approaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Apple and Amazon have displayed a more cautious or cyclical approach to AI. Apple’s incremental, quality-focused AI development could mean slower immediate demand for NVIDIA’s hardware, while Amazon’s mixed earnings from AWS indicate potential short-term constraints in GPU-related CapEx spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for NVIDIA Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors assessing NVIDIA’s outlook should closely track:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sustained strength of Microsoft’s and Meta’s AI-related earnings, indicating continued robust demand for NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of accelerated AI infrastructure investments from Apple and Amazon, potentially further boosting GPU demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic factors and tariff-related risks that could influence tech spending patterns broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight Through Competitor Comparisons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divergent strategies of these big tech firms offer valuable comparisons for NVIDIA investors. Microsoft&apos;s and Meta’s rapid and profitable AI adoption underscores the immediate positive potential for NVIDIA’s earnings. Meanwhile, the slower approaches of Amazon and Apple illustrate how varying AI strategies can impact hardware demand differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, recent big tech earnings provide clear signals of strong ongoing demand for AI infrastructure, particularly benefiting NVIDIA’s position as a critical hardware provider. Investors should closely monitor tech companies&apos; AI investment trajectories and NVIDIA&apos;s stock performance in the coming quarters for validation of these trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;Meta’s Quiet AI Revolution: More Profitable Than You Think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta Platforms&apos; recent earnings report underscores a crucial narrative investors shouldn&apos;t overlook—the company&apos;s highly effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Following the earnings release, Meta shares surged around 4.25% yesterday and continued to show resilience today, up an additional 0.9% pre-market. So, what&apos;s driving investor optimism, and how is Meta quietly becoming a top AI player?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI as a Direct Profit Driver for META Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many companies merely experimenting with AI, Meta is already achieving tangible returns. The company has successfully used AI to significantly enhance user engagement on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. With daily active users reaching 3.4 billion—over 60% of the global daily online population—Meta’s ability to sustain and grow user engagement through AI-driven personalization and content targeting is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margin Expansion at META&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta&apos;s investment in AI isn&apos;t just about boosting user numbers. AI implementation has also directly contributed to improved profitability. Meta recently reported operating margins at 41%, substantially surpassing market expectations. This profitability boost can partly be attributed to efficiency gains from AI-enhanced internal operations, including streamlined coding and content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta AI&apos;s Strategic Roadmap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta&apos;s continued strategic focus on AI, highlighting five key areas: engagement, content creation, business messaging, Meta AI chatbots, and hardware through Reality Labs. Investors should recognize this as a roadmap for sustained revenue growth and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta vs. Competitors: An Insight for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Meta&apos;s aggressive AI integration strategy with the slower approaches of competitors like Apple provides investors a valuable benchmark. While Apple&apos;s cautious pace in AI raises market uncertainties, Meta’s swift execution demonstrates how proactive AI investments can immediately and substantially benefit earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should carefully watch Meta’s stock performance in the coming quarters, particularly noting whether this strong positive sentiment continues. Continued growth in user engagement metrics and sustained margin improvements will likely reinforce Meta&apos;s position as a leader in leveraging AI for profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, Meta’s quiet AI revolution is becoming loudly profitable, offering a compelling example for investors of how AI can transform corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is provided as market commentary and does not constitute financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;China’s Shadow on Big Tech: Assessing Future Earnings Risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent earnings reports from major tech giants—Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have underscored an often-overlooked risk factor: China’s economic influence and the ongoing geopolitical tension affecting these corporations&apos; financial performance. As traders and investors digest recent stock moves, it&apos;s crucial to understand China&apos;s direct and indirect impacts on big tech earnings, now and in future quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct Impact: Production and Tariffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s latest earnings revealed significant vulnerability tied to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, with approximately 40-45% of Apple’s total revenue linked to China-based production. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged tariff-related costs could increase Apple&apos;s expenses by around $900 million in the upcoming quarter alone, pressuring profit margins significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indirect Impact: Market Access and Consumer Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta explicitly cited China&apos;s e-commerce platforms, such as Timu, as negatively affecting its revenue growth. Although Meta raised its full-year revenue guidance, it admitted the numbers would have been stronger without these external headwinds, demonstrating China’s influence beyond direct manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Shifts and Diversification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big tech companies are actively responding by diversifying production. Apple&apos;s notable shift of significant iPhone production to India and Vietnam reflects efforts to mitigate China-related risks. Investors should closely watch these strategies&apos; effectiveness, as continued dependence on China may expose companies to persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s Diversification Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Apple’s diversification strategy: shifting approximately half of U.S.-bound iPhone production to India. While this mitigates some tariff impacts, it also introduces logistical challenges and potential cost increases initially. Investors should watch closely to determine if such strategic shifts ultimately lead to sustainable margin improvements or if complications offset anticipated benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should remain vigilant about developments in U.S.-China relations, particularly ongoing tariff negotiations and regulatory changes. Future earnings reports will likely continue reflecting China’s multifaceted influence, emphasizing the importance of incorporating geopolitical risk analysis into investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while recent positive earnings from Microsoft and Meta are encouraging, investors must remain aware of China&apos;s considerable and complex role in shaping the future earnings landscape for big tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

      <title>Apple Earnings Takeaway: Apple&apos;s AI</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Apple’s AI Uncertainty: Opportunity or Risk for Investors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s latest earnings report presented investors with mixed signals. Despite solid overall performance—revenue up 5% year-over-year and services revenue climbing 12%—Apple’s stock experienced a notable drop, falling approximately 3% in pre-market trading today. What’s behind this market reaction, and why should investors pay close attention to Apple’s cautious stance on artificial intelligence (AI)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key factor influencing investor sentiment appears to be Apple&apos;s deliberate and careful approach to AI integration compared to its peers, such as Microsoft and Meta, who are rapidly scaling their AI investments. During Apple’s recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook highlighted ongoing uncertainties, particularly emphasizing Apple&apos;s commitment to high-quality AI products over speed to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should consider the following implications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delayed AI Rollouts: Apple’s personalized Siri enhancements and other AI-driven features have seen timelines pushed out, with some significant releases expected only by early 2026. This conservative rollout pace contrasts sharply with competitors aggressively monetizing AI features today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs and Supply Chain Risks: Apple&apos;s reliance on China for production remains substantial, despite efforts to diversify. With ongoing tariff uncertainties, any disruption can significantly impact profit margins, directly affecting Apple&apos;s ability to invest aggressively in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem Strength vs. Innovation Pace: Apple&apos;s robust ecosystem and strong customer loyalty offer a safety net. Yet, prolonged delays in AI innovation could erode competitive advantage, particularly if rivals significantly outperform in AI functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Apple&apos;s AI Strategy Impacts Stock Earnings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Meta’s recent earnings, where rapid AI integration significantly improved user engagement and margins, providing a direct and immediate positive impact on stock performance. Apple&apos;s slower trajectory contrasts with Meta&apos;s approach and serves as a valuable comparison for investors evaluating potential AI-driven returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors need to closely watch Apple’s progress over upcoming quarters, particularly observing if investor patience holds firm. Sustained stock weakness beyond immediate reactions to earnings reports could signal deeper market concerns regarding Apple&apos;s cautious AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Apple&apos;s prudence and meticulous quality control have traditionally served it well, investors must carefully balance these advantages against potential competitive risks posed by the accelerated pace of AI innovation in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is intended for market commentary purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

                            &lt;p&gt;A year ago, the old Bond King &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/bill-gross-look-for-10-year-yields-to-rise-above-5-over-the-next-12-months-20240502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;made a prediction&lt;/a&gt; about the path of Treasury yields. At the time, the 10-year was trading at 4.57% and he thought they were going higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those that argue for lower rates have to counter the inexorable upward climb in Treasury supply and the likely Sisyphean decline in bond prices,&quot; Gross writes. &quot;Look for 5% plus 10-year yields over the next 12 months — not 4.0%. Those that argue for lower rates have to counter the inexorable upward climb in Treasury supply and the likely Sisyphean decline in bond prices. Total Return is dead. Don’t let them sell you a bond fund.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should have bought that bond fund...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next five months, 10-year yields fell to 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, they later rebounded to 4.8% but now sit about 40 bps below his call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile. the US fiscal picture continues to deteriorate and indications from Trump&apos;s upcoming tax bill offer few signs that lowering the deficit -- which is at 7% of GDP -- is a priority. DOGE is proving to be little more than a distraction and any revenue from tariffs will be dwarfed by the cost of new tax cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point Gross will be right and those deficits will matter but that wasn&apos;t in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s the future supply of Treasuries that I want to address. The outstanding balance of Treasuries has been increasing at a 10%+ annual rate for the past 18 months — a result of fiscal post-Covid deficits of 2-3 trillion dollars. At the end of 2023’s fourth quarter there was nearly 30 trillion of outstanding public debt issued by the Federal government, growing at 10% a year,&quot; he wrote 12 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God forbid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-april-consumer-confidence-860-vs-875-expected-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;consumers are right&lt;/a&gt; about 7% inflation in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Well, this is not going well... The problem here is that the US might want to keep 10% for everyone and sell it as good news, which the market might even like (considering that it&apos;s still much lower than what was announced on April 2), but the Japanese are not budging on it.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Why it&apos;s important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ranges of estimates are 
important in terms of market reaction because when the actual data deviates from the 
expectations, it creates a surprise effect. Another
 important input in market&apos;s reaction is the distribution of forecasts. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although we can have a range of 
estimates, most forecasts might be clustered on the upper bound of the 
range, so even if the data comes out inside the range of estimates but 
on the lower bound of the range, it can still create a surprise effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Farm Payrolls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25K-195K range of estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;120K-160K range most clustered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;130K consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment Rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.3% (9%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.2% (79%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.1% (12%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Hourly Earnings Y/Y&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.9% (70%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.8% (27%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.8% (3%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Hourly Earnings M/M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.4% (2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.3% (80%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0.2% (18%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Weekly Hours &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.2 (79%) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.1 (18%) - consensus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.0 (3%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&apos;ve been saying from April 2, I don&apos;t think the data matters now as the focus remains on trade negotiations. The same way the data was influenced by the uncertainty about tariffs and then the fear of recession following the April 2 announcement, it will also be influenced by the first trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, say we get positive outcomes on the trade deals, the market will start to price in an improvement in the economy and even though the data might still show weakness in the first months, the market will likely just fade the negative reaction and keep going up on positive future expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the only outcome in the data that would trigger a market reaction is a notable weakening in the labour market as it would give the Fed a reason to cut rates. The US jobless claims, which is the most timely labour market data, continues to show a stable environment despite some volatility in the data caused by one-off factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you get less hiring given the economic uncertainty, but we haven&apos;t seen layoffs picking up yet. It&apos;s just a frozen labour market as businesses await more info on the tariffs front. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s AI Leap: Why Investors Should Pay Attention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings report has turned heads in the investing community, as shares surged dramatically by 7.63% yesterday, breaking decisively above the significant psychological threshold of $400 and currently trading around $425 in pre-market. But what specifically is fueling this bullish response, and what does it mean for investors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Microsoft&apos;s impressive earnings momentum lies a focused and strategic bet on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through its Azure cloud platform. Microsoft&apos;s substantial investments in AI have shown clear and tangible returns, especially through its integration with OpenAI’s GPT technology. This integration has positioned Azure as a formidable competitor in the rapidly growing AI and cloud computing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have reason to be optimistic about Microsoft&apos;s AI strategy due to several key factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediate Revenue Impact: Microsoft&apos;s aggressive move into AI has directly boosted its cloud revenue. Azure’s AI-driven services have attracted significant enterprise clients, bolstering recurring revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive Advantage: By integrating AI deeply into its products, Microsoft creates stronger value propositions, boosting customer retention and increasing pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalable Growth: AI investments tend to scale effectively once infrastructure costs are absorbed, suggesting potential margin expansions and sustainable earnings growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from an Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Microsoft&apos;s recent implementation of AI-powered features in its Office 365 productivity suite, particularly &quot;Copilot.&quot; Initial customer responses indicate a willingness to pay premium prices for enhanced productivity features, reflecting the immediate financial upside of strategic AI integration. This is a tangible demonstration of how Microsoft&apos;s AI focus translates directly into higher revenue and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor Microsoft&apos;s stock performance over the next several quarters. Sustaining prices comfortably above the $400 level will validate continued investor confidence and signal that Microsoft&apos;s AI strategy is robust and well-executed. Conversely, a sharp reversal below this threshold would warrant caution and reevaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Microsoft&apos;s AI-driven earnings leap is not just impressive—it&apos;s instructive. It offers traders and investors a clear case study of how targeted AI investments can rapidly translate into shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is intended for market commentary purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

      <title>Earnings Reports of Big Tech: CapEx Surge in AI</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;CapEx Surge in AI: Smart Investment or Investor Trap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon spotlight a substantial rise in capital expenditures (CapEx), primarily driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. But traders and investors alike are now grappling with a key question: Will this massive spending spree pay off, or is it potentially trapping investors in a costly, overextended bet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&apos;s recent earnings report was particularly impressive, with the stock surging 7.63% yesterday and maintaining strength in pre-market trading today. Microsoft shares decisively broke above the critical psychological level of $400, currently trading around $425, underscoring investor confidence in its AI strategy, particularly Azure’s deep integration with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Meta&apos;s earnings report showed robust results, with shares jumping about 4.25% yesterday and adding an additional 0.9% in pre-market today, indicating sustained investor enthusiasm. Meta&apos;s results suggest strong momentum driven by AI-enhanced user engagement and significantly improved margins, pointing to AI expenditures translating into immediate and tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Apple has seen more cautious investor reactions. Despite reporting solid revenue growth of 5% and service revenue up 12%, Apple shares dropped approximately 3% in pre-market trading today, primarily due to uncertainty surrounding future quarters and tariff implications cited by CEO Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon is also facing investor scrutiny despite continued investments in AI, with shares currently down around 2.5% pre-market. Amazon’s AWS unit is under particular pressure, raising questions about profitability despite the ongoing surge in AI-related CapEx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mixed reactions to earnings reports highlight the broader uncertainty about whether substantial AI-related CapEx will yield long-term returns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &amp;amp; Meta: Clearly leading in translating AI investments into immediate growth and margin expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple &amp;amp; Amazon: Exhibiting caution and facing market skepticism amid slower returns and macroeconomic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor upcoming quarters to validate whether these extensive CapEx investments in AI infrastructure lead to sustainable earnings growth or instead create substantial cost burdens, especially if macroeconomic conditions worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, traders should rely on price action as their primary indicator—no matter how compelling an earnings report or optimistic a corporate forecast appears. Sustained share-price strength or weakness over the coming weeks will deliver the market’s final verdict on these ambitious AI expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article provides market commentary and is not financial advice.

Traders are pricing in ~86% odds of that currently, largely due to a softening economic backdrop. But with core inflation still yet to actually move towards the brink of 2%, the ECB might find it tough to oversell their narrative at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&apos;s rise to the U.S. presidency was marked by a series
of bold and unconventional policy proposals that many pundits deemed radical at
the time. Given the length of the campaign and the public nature of his
platform, one would think that the market had plenty of time to prepare and
price in the potential policy shifts well in advance. However, it turned out
that investors were caught off guard by the extent of the upheaval that ensued.
Indeed, the first 100 days of Donald Trump&apos;s presidency were characterised by
extreme volatility and uncertainty for the global financial markets. In this
article, Octa broker reviews Trump&apos;s policies and analyses their consequences
for the global financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump assumed office on 20 January 2025, and market
volatility has been rising ever since. Some of Trump&apos;s initiatives,
particularly his aggressive trade policies, have sent shockwaves through
equities, currencies, and commodities, leaving retail forex traders scrambling
to adjust. Meanwhile, larger investors struggled to adapt to the rapid pace of
proposed reforms and their far-reaching consequences. Overall, the first 100
days of President Trump saw heightened risk aversion and widespread uncertainty,
which resulted in sharp fluctuations in asset prices and currency exchange
rates as traders reacted to every policy announcement, tweet, and speech from
President Trump and his new administration.Below is a list of just a few of the notable days that shook the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major market-moving events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●20 January. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)
dropped by more than 1.20% after news surfaced that the new administration will
not immediately impose trade tariffs, prompting a rally in the currencies of
some U.S. trading partners: notably, the Mexican peso (MXN), the Euro (EUR) and
the Canadian dollar (CAD). It should be noted that prior to the sharp decline,
the greenback had been rising almost uninterruptedly since September 2024,
almost reaching a three-year high ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration as the market
assumed that higher tariffs would spur inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve
(Fed) to pursue a more hawkish monetary policy. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●1–3 February. In the future, historians may
label 1 February as the official start of a global trade war. On this day,
Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with
an additional 10% tariff on China. The market&apos;s reaction was highly negative.
U.S. stock futures slumped in early Asian trading on Monday, 3 February, with
Nasdaq futures down 2.35% and S&amp;amp;P 500 futures 1.8% lower. U.S. oil prices
jumped more than $2, while gasoline futures jumped more than 3%. Meanwhile, the
Canadian dollar and Mexican peso weakened substantially, with USDCAD surging
past the 1.47900 mark, a 22-year high, and USDMXN touching a 3-year high as
economists warned that both countries were at risk of recession once the
tariffs kick in. Later that day, Trump agreed to delay 25% tariffs on Canada
and Mexico for a month after both countries agreed to take tougher measures to
combat migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●3–5 March. This is when the market began to
seriously worry about the health of the global economy and a risk-off sentiment
became evident. As fresh 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada,
along with the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, were scheduled to take effect on 4
March, investors started to sell-off the greenback and flock into gold (XAUUSD)
as well as into alternative safe-haven currencies, such as the Swiss franc
(CHF) and the Japanese yen (JPY). In just three trading sessions (from 3–5
March), DXY plunged by more than 3% while the gold price gained more than 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●6 March. Donald
Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve.
However, it was unclear how exactly this reserve would work and just how much
it would differ from Bitcoin holdings already in place. Many crypto enthusiasts
were disappointed, which triggered a five-day downturn in BTCUSD, culminating
in Bitcoin briefly dipping below the crucial $80,000 level on 10 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●2 April. The trade war entered the next
stage when Trump unveiled his long-promised &apos;reciprocal&apos; tariffs strategy,
essentially imposing import duties on more than a hundred countries. The market
route began with equity markets losing billions of dollars in valuation.
S&amp;amp;P 500 lost more than 11% in just two days, while DXY dropped to a fresh
six-month low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;●9–11 April. Trade war drama continued to
unfold. Financial markets were stunned by President Trump&apos;s abrupt reversal on
tariffs. Duties on trading partners, which had taken effect less than 24 hours
prior, were largely rolled back as the President announced a 90-day freeze on
the reciprocal tariffs. However, a 10% blanket tariff was still applied to most
nations. In contrast, the trade conflict with China escalated sharply.
Following China&apos;s 84% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, the U.S. increased
tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. This, combined with existing duties,
brought the total U.S. tariff burden on Chinese imports to 145%. Kar Yong Ang,
a financial market analyst at Octa broker, comments: &apos;I will remember that day for a long
time. Traders were stunned by Trump&apos;s sudden U-turn on trade policy and really
struggled to make sense of it all. A knee-jerk reaction was to simply buy gold
and ask questions later.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from country-based tariffs, Trump also introduced additional
import tariffs on aluminium and steel and ordered a probe into duties on copper
imports. Overall, his aggressive trade policies have fueled speculation about
the global recession, which explains why gold has been one of the
best-performing assets since Trump took office. Kar Yong Ang comments: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&apos;We are
dealing with a rather unusual situation. Even a global depression is not out of
the question as tariffs may disrupt supply chains, hurting global output while
also contributing to stronger inflationary pressure. This will certainly
complicate monetary policy decisions. If I were to describe Trump&apos;s first 100
days in just two words, it would be &quot;run
for safety&quot;.&apos; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Trump&apos;s recent public criticism of Jerome Powell, the Fed&apos;s
Chairman, added more fuel to the fire of nervous investor sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the full effect of Trump&apos;s policies is yet to materialise,
but the potential impact on global trade and the macroeconomy is substantial.
The IMF, citing escalating trade tensions, downgraded its 2025 global growth
forecast to 2.8% and warned of potential stock market crashes and a 7%
contraction in the world economy should trade wars persist. Although Scott
Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, hinted at de-escalating U.S.-China trade
tensions, it is clear that investors should still get used to living in a
period of heightened volatility and uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kar Yong Ang has this advice for an average retail trader: &apos;Focus more
on short-term trades with tight stop-losses as opposed to long-term
position-trading, cut exposure to U.S. equities, diversify into gold and other
safe-haven currencies like Swiss franc and most importantly, keep your mind
clear and be ready to quickly switch from one position to another&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance reminder:
trading Contracts for Difference (CFDs)
carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.
Emotional trading can increase this risk. Always trade within your means and
understand the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Octa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.octafx.com?utm_source=media&amp;amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TrumpsFirst100Days&amp;amp;utm_content=ww_fx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Octa&lt;/a&gt; is an international broker that has
