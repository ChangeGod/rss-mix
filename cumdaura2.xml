                            &lt;p&gt;It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that as the stock market rebounded on positive expectations for trade deals, so did Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is driven by the same macro factors that influence the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now in a bit of a consolidation as we await the next key catalyst which will likely be the details of the first trade deal. Everything revolves around that because on the rates front, the Fed is not going to cut amid this uncertainty until the labour market cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore the focus remains on that first trade deal which US officials continue to repeat will likely be announced by the end of the week (or Monday at the latest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will want to see if 10% is the floor or we can get lower. Above 10% will likely be taken as a disappointment and should trigger another selloff. Conversely, a rate below 10% (the lower the better) should take us to all-time highs pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that the price broke above the key resistance zone around the 90K level and went into a bit of a consolidation around the 95K level as the market awaits new information on the trade front. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the 90K level to position for a rally into the all-time highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to extend the drop into the 85K level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the price action formed what looks like an expanding rising wedge. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the 90K level. Watch out for the FOMC decision today as it could provide a dip-buying opportunity as the market continues to keep a positive outlook for the first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is being reported that the EU would look to propose tariffs on Boeing aircraft as potential retaliation in case trade talks with the US go south. The tariffs will be part of a list of about €100bn of annual US imports to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, that will only be part of the consideration should there be insufficient progress in reducing US tariffs. And the measures above will still have to go through approval from EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The list will be circulated either today or tomorrow but is still subject to change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

April 24, 2025, at Farea Pacifik, Le Lagon, united a powerhouse lineup of

Vanuatu’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels from her work across the Caribbean, she

leveraging innovation, and tackling barriers such as financial exclusion,
gender inequality, and climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other distinguished speakers included Hon. Jotham Napat,
Prime Minister of Vanuatu, and a vibrant roster of local experts such as
Jean-Pierre Nirua, Stephanie Senei Mahuk, and Dr. Jimmy Obed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(L): TMGM Local Director, Johnny Wilson, (R): Prime

TMGM’s acclaimed participation in the VFSC’s Second Symposium on Virtual Assets
in 2024, where the company earned accolades for Best Community Support (First
Runner-up) and Highest Client Numbers in 2024. TMGM&apos;s gold sponsorship of
#YumiStanap further solidifies its growing partnership with the Vanuatu
Financial Services Commission (VFSC). Over the past year, TMGM has worked
closely with VFSC regulators to enhance compliance standards and promote
responsible financial innovation in Vanuatu&apos;s growing digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VFSC has repeatedly acknowledged TMGM&apos;s contributions
through formal commendations. During the event, VFSC representatives
highlighted TMGM as an exemplary model of a regulated entity that balances
innovation with consumer protection, reinforcing the mutual benefits of this
strengthening public-private partnership that continues to attract positive attention
from international financial observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(L): TMGM Local Director, Johnny Wilson and (R):
VFSC Commissioner, Branan KARAE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supporting #YumiStanap is a natural extension of TMGM’s
mission to empower communities and drive sustainable financial innovation,”
said Johnny Wilson, TMGM Vanuatu’s Local Director. “We are deeply invested in
Vanuatu’s journey toward resilience and prosperity; these events are critical
catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference was more than just a discussion; it was a
launchpad for real action. Key issues addressed included economic recovery
strategies, digital innovation, education reforms, and pathways to greater
regional and global integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With media coverage across the Pacific and beyond, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmgm.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;TMGM’s&lt;/a&gt; support ensured that the voices and

      <title>Will the Fed offer a dip-buying opportunity today for the S&amp;P 500?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;We had a good run in the S&amp;amp;P 500 as the market continued to rally on de-escalation expectations. There&apos;s an old adage saying that &quot;bull markets climb a wall of worry&quot; and that&apos;s exactly what happened in the last weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went pretty quickly from strong pessimism to optimism and the positioning got a bit overstretched. Today, we have the FOMC policy decision and a pushback against the dovish market pricing could trigger some short-term weakness in the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimism for trade deals though will likely trump the negative reaction and keep the uptrend intact. The only thing I can see changing the trend at the moment is a disappointing first trade deal as the market would revise its expectations on the more negative side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a nice support zone around the 5,590 level where we can also find the trendline for confluence. That&apos;s where we can expect the dip-buyers to step in with a defined risk below the trendline to position for a rally into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to extend the pullback into the 5,456 level next. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The euro had a great performance year to date mainly due to the increased German fiscal spending expectations and Trump&apos;s tariffs. In the last four weeks though, the EURUSD pair hasn&apos;t done much due to the lack of key developments on the trade and interest rates front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB continues to cut rates amid economic uncertainty and expected slowdown from tariffs. The Fed, on the other hand, is keeping rates steady amid inflation uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short dollar trade is also overstretched, so there&apos;s the risk of some unwinding of the positioning in case the market reprices its dovish expectations for the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we will have the first test as the Fed could push back against the 80 bps of easing priced in by the market giving the greenback a boost. The next key area to watch is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;trade negotiations&lt;/a&gt; as positive developments there could see further unwinding of the short dollar trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the EURUSD pair is consolidating at a key support zone around the 1.1278 level where we can also find a trendline for confluence. This is where we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the trendline to position for a rally into the 1.16 handle. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to start targeting the 1.09 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 46.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The downturn in UK construction is seen easing a little, with house building showing some resilience. However, commercial work continues to decline and this time at its quickest pace since May 2020. So, that remains a drag. The overall sector is still in a challenging spot but at least there are some green shoots. S&amp;amp;P Global notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;UK construction companies have endured a bumpy
ride since the start of the year as domestic economic
headwinds and hesitancy among clients led to a lack of
new work to replace completed contracts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Output levels continued to slide in April, but the rate of
decline eased to its slowest for three months. This was
helped by slower reductions in residential building work
and civil engineering activity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Commercial construction was a weak spot and lost
momentum since March. Output decreased at the
fastest pace for nearly five years amid reports of greater
risk aversion among clients and a wait-and-see approach
to major spending decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Despite a sharp and accelerated fall in input buying,
strong cost pressures persisted in April. Overall input
price inflation eased only slightly from March&apos;s 26-month
peak. Survey respondents commented on rising prices
paid for a range of raw materials, as well as efforts by
suppliers to pass on greater payroll costs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;An encouraging development in April was a slight
improvement in business activity expectations for the
year ahead. Output growth projections improved to the
highest level so far this year, with a number of survey
respondents citing the prospect of a turnaround in
workloads across the residential building segment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The market could be dead wrong on rate cuts if this scenario plays out</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The Fed today is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25-4.50% and overall maintain a neutral stance given the uncertainty around tariffs and inflation expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing around 80 bps of easing by year-end
 but Fed Chair Powell could push back against such dovish 
expectations triggering a repricing to around 50 bps, which has been the Fed&apos;s baseline for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a scenario though where the Fed doesn&apos;t cut at all or delivers just one cut in 2025. The main factor for that scenario revolves around trade negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we get something very positive, like much lower than expected reciprocal tariffs or even free trade deals, there will likely be a strong surge in demand. We&apos;ve been hearing and seeing from the economic reports that business are cautious due to tariff uncertainty and that&apos;s holding back activity. With a positive resolution, economic activity will pick up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this best case scenario, the Fed could be even more constrained because there will be upward pressure on inflation and the economic data will start to show a strong rebound in activity justifying a cautious approach to rate adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something to keep in mind because such changes offer great trading opportunities as the market readjusts to new conditions. Contingency planning is an essential part of a trader&apos;s analysis. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;They are saying that if the US wants a deal, then they would have to stop threatening China. These are all fighting words but the bottom line is that we are at least taking a step towards de-escalation as both sides are set to sit down for initial talks. However, whether or not that step eventually leads to something is a separate issue though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Back in December last year, we already saw how Beijing opted for the Chinese yuan as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/is-this-beijings-first-line-of-defense-against-trump-20241203/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;its first line of defense&lt;/a&gt; in the trade war against the US. But since then, they&apos;ve also been taking other measures in safeguarding its interests. One of the more common trade practices to circumvent tariffs has been to resort to origin washing. And that is precisely what China has been actively pursuing since the turn of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The idea here is to redirect goods originally manufactured for the US market by pushing them to another port before being redirected again to finally arrive in the US. The most common workaround by China has been to export these goods to Southeast Asia as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It comes as no surprise then as Xi Jinping chose the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia as two key countries to visit during his international tour. But Thailand is also another popular destination for this so-called origin washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And from the data by the Chinese customs, it is quite clear that this is taking place. There has been a spike in exports to Southeast Asia since the turn of the year already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As China looks to prepare itself for trade talks with the US, it has also been stealthily making other moves on the chess board. This is just something to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethereum Futures Analysis. Breakout May Happen Soon!</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Ethereum Futures (Micro ETH - MET) Analysis for May 7, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum futures have been consolidating within a clearly defined range over the past few days, bounded by key price levels established earlier in the month. Since May 1 and May 2, we&apos;ve seen Ethereum trade predominantly between the lower boundary set around $1780 and an upper limit near $1866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent trading sessions (May 5-7) initially showed mixed signals. Earlier, selling pressure emerged notably, pushing prices lower, but buyer participation increased sharply thereafter, indicating that the market sees current levels as attractive. The midpoint around $1815, identified as a key point of control (POC)—an area where most trading occurred—has repeatedly acted as a pivotal zone. Initially serving as resistance, this level has gradually transformed into support, highlighting the subtle bullish shift underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zooming into today&apos;s shorter-term action, Ethereum futures experienced initial bearishness in early hours, but importantly, this was short-lived. Buyer momentum swiftly reasserted itself, significantly turning market sentiment bullish, as seen by rising volumes and increasingly positive trading activity at recent lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, as a side note, Ethereum Foundation is also working on improving things. This is the plan for the next year...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding our analysis method with orderFlow Intel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Order flow intelligence examines real-time buying and selling pressure, analyzing how aggressive traders are at specific price levels. It goes beyond traditional price charts by providing insights into actual market participation—revealing the strength of buyers or sellers at critical moments. By monitoring metrics such as the buying pressure since recent price lows (Delta since lows), Order Flow Intel helps traders anticipate price movements before they&apos;re clearly visible on regular charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Market Insights for Eth Futures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s order flow suggests a clear shift toward bullishness. The early bearish sentiment encountered substantial buyer support quickly, indicating potential institutional or larger traders stepping in. This reversal hints at increased likelihood that Ethereum futures may now target the upper part of the established range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Levels to Watch for Eth Futures Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullish Threshold: The upper boundary around $1866 remains a critical area. Traders and investors should closely watch if Ethereum prices decisively break above this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediate Support Level: Around $1828-$1830. Holding above this level keeps the short-term bullish view intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trader and Investor Guidance on Ethereum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullish Scenario: Investors and traders might look for confirmation of bullish strength through two consecutive 30-minute candle closes above the $1866 level. Such sustained moves suggest genuine buyer strength and reduce the probability of a fake breakout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearish Scenario: Alternatively, failure to sustain price action above the midpoint ($1815) and notably below immediate support ($1828-$1830) could signal renewed selling pressure, suggesting a retest of lower support levels near $1780.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation beyond the key levels above? You can grab some guidance from this potential bull flag (not activated yet)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary: Early Signs of strengthened bullish bias for ETH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current order flow analysis indicates a strengthening bullish bias for Ethereum futures, supported by recent buyer-driven market activity. Investors and traders should carefully observe price reactions near the critical $1866 threshold to confirm a genuine breakout opportunity. Sustained trading above this level, marked by consecutive 30-minute candle closes, could open further upside potential, whereas failure could suggest continued range-bound conditions or renewed downside risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice. Do your own research. Trade at your own risk. Always consider your individual strategy and risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have always been open to dialogue with the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will safeguard our interests in talks with the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Egos aside, it is still a positive development no matter who decided to take the first step to engage. The question though is, will it eventually lead to anything? As much as this first step in agreeing to talk is vital, it&apos;s another thing to expect any quick resolution to the current situation. I would expect talks to drag on for quite a while but will there be scope to lower the 145% tariffs in the meantime?&lt;/p&gt;

S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are up 0.4% on hopeful optimism of US-China trade talks but the gains have been more than halved since the headlines crossed some nine hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDJPY Technical Analysis – Will the Fed push back against the dovish pricing?</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD came under pressure
again this week as some disappointing headlines on the tariffs front hit the
sentiment. The de-escalation continues though and tonight we got the news that
the US and Chinese representatives will meet in Switzerland in the coming days
to start engaging in discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we also have the
FOMC policy decision where the Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged
and could push back against the dovish market pricing giving the greenback a boost
in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it’s been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. On the monetary policy
front, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-japan-leaves-policy-unchanged-as-widely-expected-20250501/&quot;&gt;BoJ&lt;/a&gt; kept interest rates unchanged as expected and
delivered a dovish message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was then echoed by BoJ
Governor Ueda which placed a great deal on trade developments. In summary, the
central bank is likely to go faster on rate hikes in case we get a good trade
deal and delay rate adjustments in case the trade deal disappoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY erased most of last week’s gains in the past couple of days and
threatens to extend the bearish move into the 140.00 handle. From a risk
management perspective though, the sellers will have a better risk to reward
setup around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; to position for further
downside, while the buyers will look for a break higher to increase the bullish
bets into the 151.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we broke below the strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; zone around the 144.00 handle where we had
also the upward minor trendline for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-confluence-20220318/&quot;&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt;. The sellers piled in with more
conviction on the break to target the 142.00 handle next. The buyers, on the
other hand, will likely step in around the 142.00 handle to position for a
rally back into new highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on
this timeframe. The sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to
keep pushing into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break higher to pile
in for a rally into the major trendline. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we have the FOMC Rate Decision. Tomorrow, we get the
latest US Jobless Claims figures. On Friday, we conclude the week with the
Japanese wage data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, we have a few low tier releases and the Eurozone Retail Sales report, but it&apos;s unlikely to see the market reacting to the data given that it won&apos;t change anything in terms of expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we&apos;ll have the main event of the day, which is the FOMC Policy Announcement. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25-4.50% and maintain a neutral stance given the uncertainty around tariffs and inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&apos;t for the market&apos;s expectations, I would have expected this decision to be a non-event, but there&apos;s some room for disappointment here. In fact, the market is pricing around 80 bps of easing by year-end and Fed Chair Powell will likely push back against such dovish expectations triggering a repricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the focus remains on tariff news as we continue to await the announcement of the first trade deal expected by the end of this week or Monday at the latest. Trump said that they will have a very big and very positive announcement before the Middle East trip which could come on Thursday, Friday or Monday. It could be about tariffs, so worth to keep an eye on that. &lt;/p&gt;

EUR/USD is now flat at 1.1363 with GBP/USD likewise at 1.3356. USD/JPY is still holding up though, seen at 143.05 - up 0.4% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There aren&apos;t any major expiries to take note of on the day. As things stand, trade headlines remain the biggest driver of price action and we got a taste of that earlier with some positive news on US-China talks. That is keeping the risk mood underpinned with the dollar also catching a slight bid across the board. The gains for the greenback have eased back a little but as things stand, headline risks and risk sentiment are still the two key drivers to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for the expiries, there will be bigger fish to fry in the days ahead. But we&apos;ll see if they will factor into play depending on how price action plays out in the sessions ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China, Russia have always firmly supported each other&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should jointly resist any attempt to disrupt the friendship and mutual trust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;China, Russia are both major powers with important influence in maintaining global strategic stability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No matter how the situation in Taiwan changes, China will eventually &apos;reunify&apos; with Taiwan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, speak of the devil. Reminder: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Orders/reminder-china-president-xi-to-visit-moscow-later-today-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;China president Xi to visit Moscow later today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Xi might be in Moscow to offer his support to Putin against the West. But as mentioned, the solidarity on the military front is also one that strikes back home. And Xi is making that clear with the warning about Taiwan above again.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s no doubt a symbolic show of support for Putin with Xi set to also attend a parade on Friday, one that commemorates the 80th anniversary of the World War II victory over Germany by Russia and its allies. The solidarity on the military front will also strike back home, with Taiwan and Vietnam in particular also watching closely as Beijing is concocting its own plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But perhaps there&apos;s also another thing on the agenda here. And that is the show of camaraderie in fighting back against the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Xi&apos;s visit no doubt comes at an interesting time now with US and China preparing for an early round of talks to take stock on trade later this weekend. Markets are hoping for de-escalation but China&apos;s posturing will depend a lot on how Xi wants to play this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So, be watchful of comments from the Chinese president during his time in Russia as well over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

China then doubled down to bolster risk sentiment further in Asia trading, by delivering a host of supportive measures including a slew of rate cuts. Eamonn&apos;s got the summary on that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/pboccsrc-china-supportive-measures-in-summary-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; before adding one more to the relending rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/pboc-to-also-cut-relending-rate-by-25-bps-to-150-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For now, hope springs eternal. There is good chance for de-escalation but what does that really mean is a separate discussion. But market players are taking on a more optimistic side for the time being. Buy the rumour, as one would put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But as a reminder, the bar is set relatively low. At 145% tariffs currently, any step down to allow for some trade to be facilitated instead of no trade at all is an improvement. However, if we do move to 50-60% tariffs, it&apos;s still a major hit to both economies. But at least, there are signs of trying to work something out I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Come what may, the end goal is basically what markets have to really consider ultimately. If it is moving towards de-escalation and slow removal of tariffs or a much lower level, then sure there is something to be cheerful about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But if the base case is for higher tariffs in general i.e. Trump hoodwinking the world into forcing tariffs on everyone, I think that&apos;s a consequence towards the global economy that markets have yet to really price in. But for now, baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
