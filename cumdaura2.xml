                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;100&quot; data-end=&quot;286&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley is sounding the alarm on the rapidly intensifying electric vehicle (EV) race, suggesting China may have already clinched victory in the hardware battle—and Tesla knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;288&quot; data-end=&quot;776&quot;&gt;In a recent note, the investment bank argues that the launch of Xiaomi’s new SU7—which it describes as an “electric Ferrari at a Volkswagen price”—is a watershed moment. The SU7, and now the similarly styled YU7, blend premium design cues reminiscent of the Ferrari Purosangue and Aston Martin DBX with pricing closer to a Volkswagen ID.3 or Tesla Model Y, fundamentally raising the competitive bar for every global carmaker targeting the US$30,000–40,000 segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;778&quot; data-end=&quot;1221&quot;&gt;The speed and scale at which Chinese tech firms are combining high performance with affordability is forcing Tesla to shift its value proposition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If China has already won the EV hardware race, the next battlefield—and margin pool—is full self-driving software and data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tesla’s pivot from “best car” to “best autonomy stack” is seen as a direct response to the shrinking defensibility of its traditional EV advantage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1223&quot; data-end=&quot;1526&quot;&gt;Xiaomi’s breakneck pace is especially notable. The YU7 is only its second model, but even Ford’s CEO has admitted that U.S. legacy automakers are years away from fielding a comparable offering. By the time they catch up, Xiaomi’s third-generation vehicles will likely have moved the goalposts again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1528&quot; data-end=&quot;1829&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley projects Xiaomi’s EV business could generate RMB 233 billion (around US$32 billion) in revenue by 2027—roughly matching Tesla’s total automotive sales from 2020. That level of scaling in just three model generations compresses what used to take incumbent carmakers a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1831&quot; data-end=&quot;2220&quot;&gt;While Western governments may use tariffs to slow the tide, Morgan Stanley warns that top-tier Chinese EVs are likely to find their way to premium buyers regardless. In fact, some global automakers are already exploring joint ventures or tech licensing deals with Chinese firms to gain access to critical EV and autonomy expertise while limiting capital expenditure and execution risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2222&quot; data-end=&quot;2651&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the bank’s view, equity markets are placing too much emphasis on Tesla’s near-term vehicle margins, underestimating the impact of incoming low-cost Chinese competition. The note underscores Tesla’s strategic shift toward autonomy as the company’s next defensible growth engine—spanning robo-taxis, logistics, and other mobility platforms—as it braces for a future shaped increasingly in Beijing, not Detroit or Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;328&quot;&gt;New Zealand has revised its fiscal outlook, projecting a smaller budget deficit and adjusting bond issuance plans as it navigates a still-challenging economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;330&quot; data-end=&quot;657&quot;&gt;On Thursday, the government forecast a budget deficit of NZ$14.74 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, a notable improvement from the NZ$17.32 billion shortfall projected in its December half-year update. The narrowing reflects improved revenue expectations and a slightly firmer economic backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;659&quot; data-end=&quot;897&quot;&gt;At the same time, net debt is now forecast to peak at 46% of GDP in 2027/28, slightly later but marginally lower than the 46.5% peak in 2026/27 projected last December. The shift suggests a more measured fiscal consolidation path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;899&quot; data-end=&quot;1152&quot;&gt;The New Zealand Debt Management Office (NZDMO) also trimmed its near-term bond issuance plans. For the 2025/26 fiscal year, gross bond issuance is expected to total NZ$38 billion, down from NZ$40 billion projected in the December update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1434&quot;&gt;However, the government raised its total bond issuance forecast for the four-year period to June 2029 to NZ$132 billion, up from NZ$128 billion. The revision reflects longer-term funding needs amid a broader economic transition and continued infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1436&quot; data-end=&quot;1593&quot;&gt;Despite the moderated borrowing profile in the near term, officials signaled a continued commitment to fiscal discipline and longer-term debt sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;153&quot; data-end=&quot;367&quot;&gt;Gold prices are poised to rise to $3,750 per ounce by the fourth quarter, driven by rising safe-haven demand and a weakening U.S. dollar, according to a new report from Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;369&quot; data-end=&quot;735&quot;&gt;In a note from Vivek Dhar, director of mining and energy commodities research at CBA, the bank highlighted geopolitical tensions—particularly the risk of military escalation involving Iran—as a key upside risk for bullion. “The threat of military strikes against Iran cannot be ruled out, which raises the stakes if U.S.-Iran talks remain deadlocked,” Dhar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;737&quot; data-end=&quot;947&quot;&gt;Gold’s traditional role as a safe haven may become even more pronounced, the report suggests, especially as it has recently outperformed both the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasurys amid rising American tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;949&quot; data-end=&quot;1096&quot;&gt;CBA also expects the dollar to gradually weaken through the second half of 2025 and into 2026, further supporting the bullish gold outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;949&quot; data-end=&quot;1096&quot;&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;949&quot; data-end=&quot;1096&quot;&gt;China on the bid again today?&lt;/p&gt;

Noguchi hasn&apos;t said this exactly but it seems to be his overall message. I&apos;d say he is sounding more dovish than hawkish though. Comments welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;China and 10 ASEAN countries have concluded negotiations on CAFTA Version 3.0, a major upgrade of their free trade agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deal introduces nine new chapters focused on areas like the digital economy, green economy, and supply chain connectivity, aiming to deepen regional integration and economic cooperation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officials say CAFTA 3.0 will enhance trade stability, foster industrial and technological collaboration, and provide institutional support for efficient and secure supply chains. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With bilateral trade nearing USD 1 trillion in 2024, both sides see this as a key step toward high-quality development and a strong signal in favour of open, rule-based multilateral trade. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formal signing of the agreement is expected by the end of 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.news.cn/20250522/002d513015e846cf848b555bd64e52b5/c.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Link here for more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China  + ASEAN Member States:

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These eleven countries form the CAFTA 3.0, an upgraded free trade agreement aiming to deepen economic integration between China and the ASEAN bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Giving very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will be making a decision in near future&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that play a central role in the housing finance system. They don’t lend money directly to homebuyers but instead buy mortgages from banks and other lenders, providing those institutions with fresh capital to issue more home loans. By packaging these mortgages into securities and guaranteeing them against default, Fannie and Freddie help make housing credit more widely available and affordable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were placed under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent their collapse, and they remain under federal control today.&lt;/p&gt;
