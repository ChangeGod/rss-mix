                            &lt;p&gt;The major US stock indices are opening lower after the Moody&apos;s downgrade in other weekend news. The White House is stripping about other deals. China is upset about Chip restrictions. Israel is not looking to peace.  Russia&apos;s Putin is not cooperating. US House comes to a agreement on the budget deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market 4 minutes into the open agent showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -210.06 points or -0.49% at 42444.68.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P Annex -53.36 points are -0.95% at 5905.02&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -239.66 points or -5.25% at 18971.45.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index 5-day win streak is in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of some of the big names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;48&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2&quot; data-end=&quot;48&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Broadcom (AVGO): $226.56, ▼2.06 (-0.90%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;49&quot; data-end=&quot;108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;51&quot; data-end=&quot;108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Super Micro Computer (SMCI): $45.09, ▼1.06 (-2.30%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;109&quot; data-end=&quot;153&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;111&quot; data-end=&quot;153&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Intel (INTC): $21.21, ▼0.45 (-2.08%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;154&quot; data-end=&quot;215&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;156&quot; data-end=&quot;215&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): $114.88, ▼2.30 (-1.96%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;216&quot; data-end=&quot;272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;218&quot; data-end=&quot;272&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon (AMZN): $203.73, ▼1.86 (-0.90%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;320&quot; data-end=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;322&quot; data-end=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple (AAPL): $205.13, ▼6.13 (-2.91%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;366&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;368&quot; data-end=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meta Platforms (META): $633.25, ▼7.09 (-1.11%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;421&quot; data-end=&quot;470&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;423&quot; data-end=&quot;470&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Microsoft (MSFT): $455.32, ▲1.05 (+0.23%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;471&quot; data-end=&quot;520&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;473&quot; data-end=&quot;520&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL): $165.25, ▼0.94 (-0.57%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;521&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;523&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adobe (ADBE): $416.44, ▼0.69 (-0.16%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;567&quot; data-end=&quot;611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;569&quot; data-end=&quot;611&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nvidia (NVDA): $134.04, ▼1.36 (-1.00%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;FOMC Gov. Jefferson is speaking and says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The impact of tariffs on the Fed&apos;s mandate is top of mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risks to the Fed&apos;s mandates depends on policy choices by the administration that have not been made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are risks to both jobs and inflation, but given uncertainty it is appropriate to wait and see on right decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US could face a one-time increase in the price level tariffs, need to be sure that does not become a sustained increase in inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will keep policy in place to be sure inflation expectations remain anchored&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far the labor market has been very resilient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is too early to tell how the labor market will be affected by administration policies &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no active conversations about changing the ample reserve operations framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked about the Moody&apos;s downgrade, says that is trying to fulfill its price and jobs mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downgrade will be treated the same as other incoming data, with focus on implications for jobs and inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Everyone is downplaying the Moody&apos;s downgrade  as either late or irrelevant but I&apos;ll take the other side of that. In fact, what bothers me is that so many people in the administration and Congress are downplaying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a truly AAA-rated country, when there is a downgrade, there is a reckoning. I don&apos;t see that at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment is something of a fork in the road with Republicans in a position to reign in US spending while also dialing down the &apos;ask&apos; on tax cuts. Instead, the US seems to be gripped (on all sides) by an idea that if there aren&apos;t going to be any brakes, then they might as well step on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market isn&apos;t happy today with US 30-year yields up 13 bps and in danger of breaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are some real fiscal hawks left in Congress and this is the rallying point but yesterday the House Budget Committee that grandstanded on Friday promptly approved the bill 17-16 along party lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those conservatives have insisted that Medicaid work requirements take 
effect immediately and that the clean energy tax credits be eliminated 
sooner,&quot; NBC News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/key-house-committee-advances-trump-agenda-bill-conservatives-rcna207555&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone think this bill won&apos;t pass?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;New York Fed president John Williams is speaking to the Mortgage Bankers Association in New York City. Williams is a permanent voting member on the Federal Reserve Board:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent economic data has been very good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labor market is pretty much in balance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First quarter growth was unusual trade issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Inflation has been coming down slowly and gradually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keyword for economy is uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monetary policy is in a good place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed rate policy is well-positioned. It is slightly restrictive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some forward-looking indicators are signaling concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade is particular point of uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many firms and households are in a wait-and-see mode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed has a ways to go in shrinking its balance sheet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance sheet drawdown not affecting market prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dollar remains the world&apos;s reserve currency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global investors associate USS place to invest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are not seeing major changes in investor interest in treasury bonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core fixed income markets have been functioning really well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers are still in good shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeing some signs and data of rising consumer caution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The economy is likely to slow this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is going to take some time to get read on economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed can take it time on monetary policy decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs potentially raise inflation and unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments remain balanced as a Fed awaits the impact from tariffs mainly. When the keyword is &quot;uncertainty&quot;, they Fed is on hold until they get the next shove from the economy.   He does warn that the economy is likely to slow, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the premarket for US stocks still remain negative: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -233.74 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -58.63 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -290 point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the US debt market at 9 AM ET: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.025%, +4.2 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.147%, +8.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.562%, +2.1 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 5.032%, +13.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;There was a report in the FT last week indicating that US-Japan trade negotiations were on hold and would likely stay that way through the July Japanese elections. Kowtowing to the US ahead of July elections would be deeply unpopular in Japan and it looks like they&apos;re going to punt until afterwards, even at the risk of rising reciprocal tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox Business&apos; Charlie Gasparino has repeatedly said a Japan agreement was close but now he&apos;s reporting that&apos;s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The US-Japan trade agreement framework is being delayed in part over negotiations over so-called burden sharing, or how much money Japan has to kick in to support US military in Japan (also known as protection from Chinese aggression)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there might be a deal to be made around military spending and investment in Alaska LNG but it&apos;s tough to get there unless the US is willing to take tariffs to zero. There was also an interesting report this weekend via Bloomberg suggesting that China got a better deal by punching back and that could be the playbook now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is lower to start the trading week as investors sell US stocks, bonds after the Moody&apos;s downgrade of US debt late Friday.  The USD is down -0.90% vs the EUR, and -0.81% vs the GBP. to start the session The greenback is down -0.42% vs the JPY. The video above outlines the technical levels in play for those three major currency pairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you likely know already, the rating agency Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating on Friday from Aaa to Aa1, citing the nation’s soaring $36 trillion debt and persistent fiscal deficits. The move, which comes after similar downgrades by other agencies a year of so ago, signals growing concern over America’s long-term fiscal outlook and rising interest costs. While Moody’s shifted its outlook from “negative” to “stable,” the downgrade sparked backlash from Trump allies, who criticized the decision as politically motivated. The change could complicate President Trump’s efforts to cut taxes and balance the budget, especially as investors remain unconvinced by revenue-raising tariffs and cost-cutting measures. The announcement sent Treasury yields higher after the market close, raising the risk of bond market instability when trading resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhiile, the House panel approved the Trump Tax cut plan. That will lead to a vote this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Fed,  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic this morning on CNBC warned that Moody’s downgrade could have wide-reaching effects across the economy and financial markets, particularly by raising the cost of capital and introducing greater uncertainty. He emphasized that it may take several months to fully understand the impact on U.S. debt demand and inflation from tariffs. Bostic noted the Fed is cautious on rate cuts, leaning toward just one this year due to the complex interplay of inflation, tariffs, and economic sentiment. While markets are functioning well, inflation remains above target and expectations are moving in a troubling way, although firms aren’t planning large layoffs. He highlighted a disconnect between economic sentiment and data and pointed to potential ripple effects from even reduced tariffs on China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In geopolitical news, Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich stated that Israel aims to continue the war to push Gaza’s population southward and potentially out of the territory, according to Sky News Arabia. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take full control of Gaza, while Israeli forces expanded ground operations and conducted airstrikes that killed at least 100 people. Israel&apos;s government also said it would allow limited humanitarian aid into Gaza to prevent a hunger crisis. Pres. Trump said on Friday a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month in Gaza, but warned that something bad would happen if Iran does not move in nuclear talks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ukraine stated that Kyiv prioritizes a ceasefire in its ongoing discussions with the Russian delegation and is open to exploring a potential meeting between President Zelensky and President Putin. This aligns with earlier remarks from U.S. President Trump, who expressed willingness to meet with both leaders once arrangements are made. Attention now turns to determining the specific timing of any such meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are lower with the futures implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures implying a decline of -258 point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures are implying a decline of -63 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures are implying a decline of -311 points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets, the major indices are mixed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, unchange&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.68%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, -0.36%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.24% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, -1.80%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are higher after the Moody&apos;s downgrade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.025%, +4.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.131%, +6.9 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.536%, +9.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 5.007%, +11.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil down $0.57 or -0.90% at $61.41&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver up $0.32 or 1.01% at $32.60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is up $40.62 or 1.27% at $3242.41&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading down $3790 at $102,719&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian dollar is lagging today and a portion of that is likely due to the local holiday. Canadian markets are closed today for Victoria Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also an unofficial holiday for the large part of the country that can&apos;t stand the Toronto Maple Leafs as they were routed in a playoff elimination game yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

The most notable ones have been the US Dollar and the long term US Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback got beaten up hour after hour as the session progressed. It&apos;s been particularly weak against the EUR and GBP where the positive news on the &quot;EU-UK reset deal&quot; were likely a contributing factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US bond market, long term Treasury yields continued to rise following the Moody&apos;s downgrade with the newswires reporting on every bps increase after the US 30 year yield crossed the 5% level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Bitcoin erased all the weekend gains as it followed the US stock market lower. And in the last part of the session, we got Fed&apos;s Bostic repeating that his base case remains one rate cut in 2025 as he&apos;s worrying about the inflation part of the mandate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the calendar is still empty on the data front but we will have more Fed speakers sharing their views. Fed&apos;s Williams in particular could be important. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moody&apos;s downgrade will cut across economics, financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downgrade will have implications for cost of capital, could ripple through economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will have to wait and see about impact of downgrade on demand for US debt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fed will have to determine how the downgrade effects an outlook that is already in flux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s unclear if consumers today can take on the full cost of tariffs given the state of household balance sheets, recent inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have to wait 3-6 months to see how uncertainty settles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of rate cuts this year depends on how things turn out, the details of the tariffs will matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaning more towards only one cut this year because it will take time to understand tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a scenario where tariffs become less of a story over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the tariff transition is longer, it may impact consumer behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treasury markets are functioning quite well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation not moving to target as fast as anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty means there is higher risk, the Fed only controls one part of the price of capital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As things get more expensive, it changes the choices policymakers, households and businesses face, that will influence the path of the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have not seen much movement on the jobs side, firms say they don&apos;t have plans for large layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation expectations are moving in a troubling way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I worry a lot about the inflation side of out mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right now see more risk of higher inflation than the employment side of the mandate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decline in sentiment is not yet playing out in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May be at a point where the distance between sentiment and data starts to narrow; inventory rundown may be nearing an end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market volatility in April did not feel that close to a significant financial event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volatility reflected people adjusting to new expectations, information about tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even the reduced tariffs on China are economically significant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bostic is a hawk and he&apos;s not a voting member in 2025. He&apos;s been supporting just one rate cut this year as he&apos;s placing more weight on the inflation side of the mandate given that inflation hasn&apos;t moved to target as fast as anticipated. He&apos;s also worrying about inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The USD is not the only one having a rough day as Bitcoin erased all the weekend gains</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;There have been lots of people cheering for the Bitcoin rally over the weekend saying that events like the US credit rating downgrade are bullish for the cryptocurrency. Unfortunately for them, Bitcoin is just another risk asset and, given similar drivers, it&apos;s correlated to the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart below, we can see that Bitcoin is bouncing on a major trendline. We are also overextended on the day, so the dip buyers could start piling in around these levels looking for a rally into new all-time highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to start targeting a deeper pullback into the 95,000 price area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much downside for the stock market or bitcoin at the moment, but the &quot;easy&quot; gains were made from the bottom as we repriced growth expectations. Now we are near overstretched levels as greed and FOMO are keeping the momentum going. The risks I see ahead is a hawkish Fed that triggers another repricing in interest rates expectatios, which would weigh on bitcoin in the short-term. Economic data and inflation risks will be key. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a rough day for the US Dollar so far. This is just the daily trend that was set &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-us-dollar-under-pressure-again-to-start-the-session-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;earlier in the morning&lt;/a&gt;. The &quot;good news&quot; for the greenback is that we might have reached the peak in the bearish momentum today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the EURUSD chart below, we can see that the price is now near the top of the average daily range (red line), which stands right at the key 1.1278 resistance zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where we can expect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the resistance to position for a drop into the 1.10 handle. The buyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to start targeting new highs, but from a risk management perspective, entering at the highs would be pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s not much on the agenda today that could help the greenback, but Fed speakers might give it a boost if we get some more hawkish comments, especially from Fed&apos;s Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US Dollar opened lower today and after a bit of a consolidation during the Asian session, started to depreciate again in the European session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moody&apos;s downgrade is cited as the culprit although there are also other drivers. One above all is that the market has repriced interest rates expectations for the Fed to reflect the central bank&apos;s base case of two cuts in 2025. Therefore, we would need stronger reasons to price out the remaining cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had some upside in the greenback following the higher inflation expectations in the UMich survey last Friday but those gains didn&apos;t last for long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only bullish scenario for the dollar now is that we get strong economic data or more hawkish Fed comments, so that the remaining rate cuts get priced out and give the greenback another short-term boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as better global growth remains the main driver, the USD should keep on depreciating against its peers, but if inflation starts to become a concern, then we will likely see more upside for the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Canada has a bank holiday for Victoria Day, and in the U.S., several FOMC members are expected to deliver remarks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the focus will be on the RBA monetary policy announcement, followed later in the day by Canadian inflation data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, the U.K. will release its inflation data and on Thursday, flash manufacturing and services PMIs will be released for the eurozone, the U.K., and the U.S.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Friday, Japan will publish its national core CPI y/y, while the U.K. and Canada will release their retail sales data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this week&apos;s meeting, the RBA is widely expected to deliver a 25 bps rate cut, lowering the cash rate from 4.10% to 3.85%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, inflation data in Australia has softened, with the trimmed mean CPI dipping to 2.9%, now within the RBA&apos;s target range. Headline inflation held steady at 2.4%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wages rose 3.4% y/y, driven by public sector agreements, while private sector wage growth remained stable. April’s jobs report surprised to the upside, adding 89,000 positions, and the unemployment rate held at 4.1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The RBA is expected to continue cutting rates through the end of the year. However, Wells Fargo analysts argue that solid domestic data and easing China-U.S. trade tensions reduce the likelihood of further policy easing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus for the CPI m/m is 0.5%, up from the prior 0.3%. The median CPI y/y is expected to remain unchanged at 2.9%, while the trimmed CPI y/y is projected to rise from 2.8% to 2.9%, and the common CPI y/y is likely to increase from 2.3% to 2.4%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts from RBC argue that Canada’s April CPI is likely to reflect a drop in headline inflation, primarily due to the removal of the consumer carbon tax on energy products at the beginning of the month. They emphasize that the distortion stems from a temporary federal tax relief measure, which included the GST rebate and ended in February. As a result, annual inflation is forecast to fall sharply from 2.3% in March to 1.6%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts do not expect the effects of tariffs to be reflected in this month’s data just yet. Retaliatory tariffs are anticipated to have a limited impact on consumer prices, as businesses pivot to alternative import sources and consumers shift toward non-tariffed goods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian food price growth is expected to remain elevated at 3.2% y/y in April, with core inflation rising to 2.6%. March retail sales, due this week, are expected to have rebounded to 0.7% from a February decline, driven by pre-tariff auto purchases. While auto sales likely dipped in April, broader consumer spending appears resilient despite weaker sentiment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.K., the consensus for CPI y/y is 3.3%, up from the prior 2.6%. Core CPI y/y is likely to rise from 3.4% to 3.6%, while services inflation is expected to come in below the BoE’s forecast of 5%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at ING emphasized that April’s inflation data carries extra weight, as it is typically the month when a wide range of services prices are reset for the year. Both April 2023 and 2024 delivered surprises that jolted markets, often with stronger-than-expected prints.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of monetary policy, the BoE is not finished with rate cuts just yet, with another reduction expected at either the June or August meeting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&apos;s PMI data for the eurozone will offer a clearer picture of how the economy is holding up. Last month, the services sector declined to 50.1, while manufacturing remained in contractionary territory at 49, and the composite PMI slipped from 50.9 to 50.4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, conditions in the euro area appear to have stabilized, supported by easing E.U.–U.S. trade tensions, political stability in Germany, and softening inflation data, all of which point to a modest pickup in activity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, the consensus for the national core CPI y/y is for an increase from 3.2% to 3.5%. This rise is largely attributed to the effects of reduced energy subsidies and new price hikes in sectors such as food and education. Tokyo CPI, often viewed as a bellwether, surprised to the upside earlier this month, climbing to 3.4% y/y, while the core print excluding fresh food and energy surged to 3.1%, its highest level in over a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a reminder, the BoJ left rates unchanged at its May meeting but signaled openness to further hikes if inflation remains persistent. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and signs of weakening global demand complicate the outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;What Price Will Bitcoin Hit in May? Polymarket Bets Provide Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As investors and traders navigate the volatile crypto market, many ask, &quot;What price will Bitcoin hit in May?&quot; Prediction markets such as Polymarket have gained popularity by offering speculative insight through aggregated bets, potentially indicating the market&apos;s collective sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Polymarket’s betting data for Bitcoin&apos;s price by the end of May shows significant predictions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below $80k: 2% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$85k: 5% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$90k: 11% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$110k: 38% probability (highest probability)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$115k: 15% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$125k: 2% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$150k: 1% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$200k: less than 1% probability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the strongest sentiment among bettors anticipates Bitcoin will reach around $110,000 by the month&apos;s end, reflected in a notable 38% likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Polymarket Accurate in Predicting Bitcoin Prices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymarket&apos;s accuracy has been the subject of research. A recent study from CoinDesk (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/21/polymarket-is-94-accurate-in-predicting-world-events-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/21/polymarket-is-94-accurate-in-predicting-world-events-research&lt;/a&gt;) suggests Polymarket is approximately 94% accurate when predicting outcomes within hours of resolution. Even one month in advance, its accuracy remains impressively high, above 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the predictive strength varies significantly with longer-term forecasts. CoinCodex (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coincodex.com/article/65963/is-polymarket-accurate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.coincodex.com/article/65963/is-polymarket-accurate&lt;/a&gt;) highlights that accuracy diminishes as the prediction timeframe extends, due to increased unpredictability and market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cautions for Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, bettors should be aware that Polymarket reflects sentiment rather than guaranteed outcomes. Additionally, a Medium article (medium.com/@balajibal/why-are-polymarket-betters-losing-money-af3cc506fd9a) highlights that the majority of bettors typically experience losses, underscoring the speculative nature of these bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Polymarket as a Sentiment Gauge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a crystal ball, Polymarket provides a useful barometer of market expectations. Traders and investors can combine Polymarket insights with technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As May progresses, Bitcoin watchers can continue monitoring Polymarket&apos;s evolving probabilities to better understand where collective market sentiment might push prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Price Forecast for the End of May 2025 is Apx. $110k (... but do not take any of this as a guarantee!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what price will Bitcoin hit in May? While no method guarantees results, Polymarket’s current sentiment strongly suggests a target near $110,000. Investors are encouraged to use this insight prudently alongside broader market analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
