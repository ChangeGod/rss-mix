                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;From before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-calls-for-its-airlines-to-halt-any-further-boeing-jet-deliveries-amid-trade-strife-20250415/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;China calls for its airlines to halt any further Boeing jet deliveries amid trade strife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That helps to some extent but with the relative uncertainty of what might come next in the US-China trade war, I reckon Chinese airlines will continue to lean more and more towards Airbus - which already holds the dominant market share.&lt;/p&gt;

Things are settling down now as we take a light breather to digest the US-China tariffs reduction and 90-day pause for talks to progress. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.3% but that follows from 3.3% gains overnight, in which the index cleared both its 100 and 200-day moving averages comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, we don&apos;t have much on the agenda other than the German ZEW survey and BoE&apos;s Pill speech. The ZEW index is expected to rebound on easing trade fears and BoE&apos;s Pill is unlikely to say anything new since he spoke just last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we get the US CPI report where the Core Y/Y figure is expected at 2.8% vs. 2.8% prior, while the M/M measure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.1% prior. I think the data will now start to get more and more important as the expectations around an average 10% global tariff rate solidify. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk going forward shouldn&apos;t be growth anymore. It will likely be inflation as economic activity picks up. &lt;/p&gt;

ONS might still have some data inconsistencies on accuracy but the bigger picture trend has been playing out quite straightforward at least. As for wages, real earnings is at least continuing to come down a little but is still on the higher side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s hard to read too much into the data given the mix of things. But balancing this out with the BOE messaging, it won&apos;t press policymakers to desperately go with a rate cut next month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the US and China striking a deal to lower tariffs after the talks over the weekend, we&apos;re going to see things go back to normal now right? Well, not quite. The thing is tariffs policy can change on a flick of a dime. However, the issue with the impact that it causes is that supply chains cannot adjust and change up that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;After the tit-for-tat retaliation last month, the tariff levels have effectively placed a trade embargo between both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In essence, that has caused shipments to be paused with empty containers building up at major ports. Meanwhile, some factories have also surely decided to halt production during this period. When shipments are paused, suppliers will also stop production as there is little certainty on how this tariffs war was going to play out previously. It&apos;s only prudent from a cost-saving perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But what happens now that the US and China have suddenly decided to drop back tariff levels again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Sure, 30% is still high but now that&apos;s a cost that some firms will have to decide whether they can absorb. I mean after 90 days, who is to say that tariffs won&apos;t return to be higher again? That&apos;s the risk and uncertainty that many firms are squaring up to right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If you can absorb that, it means trying to rush as many orders out in the next 90 days as possible. However, supply chains can&apos;t turn back on with a flip of a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Everyone scrambling to stock up on inventory again and shipments will resume. But amid the rush, vessels will face space limitations and ports will face heavy congestion and bottlenecks. Just think back to how it was back during the Covid pandemic when lockdowns eased. It&apos;s the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And even for factories resuming production, it&apos;s not that simple. It takes time for production lines to get back to full speed and some may have even already reallocated labour work during the past month. This may take weeks in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s all very messy and less straightforward as saying that with lower tariffs, things can easily go back to where they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;All this is not to mention the thousands of backlogs that have been caused in the last month that still needs catching up to do. If you haven&apos;t already booked shipments from China to the US, you&apos;re already probably too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So even with the reduction in tariffs, firms will still have to plan for potential delays due to backlogs and the time needed for shipments and factories to ramp up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;At best, these delays might just last for a month or so. However, they could easily be prolonged for the next three to four months in some cases as well. That will make for a challenging summer for major firms reliant on supplies/inventories from China. If you&apos;re a big player like Amazon or Walmart, you&apos;ll do fine. But for the smaller guys, it&apos;s going to be tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The good news at least is that the tariffs reduction looks to be coming just before major ports in the US are to receive shipments from China in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So, any major disruptions from the initial tariffs that caused the trade embargo was due to hit around mid-to-end May at the earliest. But I guess, that can be course corrected now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That being said, the cascading effect to supply chains is something that won&apos;t be so easy to fix. With the 90 days pause, US consumers are also going to get in as much orders as they can now in case there might be future price hikes again. And in turn, that will drain existing inventory at a much quicker pace too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;All of this will lead to a bullwhip effect that will just exacerbate the supply chain problems as listed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The spike in demand that we&apos;ll see during this period will lead to shipments being overbooked (shipping costs to surge as such) with not enough vessels to accommodate the surge in orders. That will then lead to ports being congested and facing bottlenecks (causing delays and adding to backlogs of inventories). Eventually when it all dies down, firms may fall into an overstock cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And if tariffs are to be raised again, then we&apos;ll just start this whole process once more. And again, it will take months for supply chains to return to normal - if it ever does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So, yeah. Tariffs policy can change overnight but supply chains cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US to reduce de minimis tariff on China shipments from 120% to 54%</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This follows up from this part here yesterday: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-china-deal-reportedly-does-not-cover-de-minimis-exemption-for-e-commerce-shipments-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;US-China deal reportedly does not cover de minimis exemption for e-commerce shipments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s some comfort I guess that the duty/import charges will be reduced. But at 54%, it is still high for the average consumer. The de minimis exemption was eliminated previously so I don&apos;t believe the $800 threshold is back in place. Also, just be aware that the $100 fee will be increased to $200 after 1 June as per the previous arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I mean even at 54%, it&apos;s still a taxing amount. It&apos;s not as bad as paying double the amount now but consumers will essentially still pay at least 1.5 times the amount for goods with country of origin (COO) labeled China.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECB reportedly to largely endorse past policy measures in strategy review</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report says that the ECB will brush aside calls for self-criticism and stand by its aggressive stimulus policy during the past decade in its strategy review. The review began in March and is believed to try and address issues such as whether QE, negative rates, and forward guidance have been appropriate tools in policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The sources said that the ECB is likely to keep a reference to the need for &quot;especially forceful or persistent action&quot; in justifying their past decisions to push for QE and other stimulus measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, there is said to be a general agreement that forward guidance should be used parsimoniously especially after it led to the ECB reacting too late to the inflation surge in 2021 and 2022. I think that was more of a case of ignorance though. Remember the whole &quot;inflation is transitory&quot; episode? Geez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for the review as a whole, the report notes that some policymakers are feeling a bit displeased with the preliminary conclusions though. They were hoping for it to be more critical on past policy decisions but it doesn&apos;t feel like it when viewing the sentiment above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, much like the whole &quot;inflation is transitory&quot; episode in the past years, they&apos;re just not wanting to admit to any possible missteps they have made. Egoistic.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Amid the latest agreement struck between the US and China, Goldman Sachs is now seeing the probability of a recession in the US over the next 12 months at 35%. Their previous projection was 45%. Given that, they are now expecting the Fed to only deliver one rate cut this year as compared to their previous forecast of three rate cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, the firm also raises its year-end target for the S&amp;amp;P 500 to 6,100 now - up from 5,900 previously.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There aren&apos;t any major expiries to take note of on the board for today. As such, traders will be sticking to the broader risk mood as the key driver of trading sentiment. After the bustling gains in risk yesterday, we&apos;re seeing things settle down a bit. And that&apos;s also leading to some cooling off in the dollar gains so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That&apos;s the main factor that will drive price action in the session ahead, to see if the mood music from yesterday will continue or if we&apos;re going to settle down to digest the situation a bit more. But coming up later, there is the US CPI report to watch out for as an added key risk event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

data-end=&quot;305&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After Monday’s sharp swings, Asia markets settled into a more subdued session on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;307&quot; data-end=&quot;731&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Japanese yen found some relief, rebounding from early highs above 148.40 to around 147.75. The move was spurred by comments from Japan’s Finance Minister Kato, who said he hopes to speak with U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent on FX matters during the upcoming G7 meetings in Banff, Canada (May 20–22). The remarks were seen as a subtle warning about the yen’s recent weakness and a possible prelude to verbal intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;733&quot; data-end=&quot;1181&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier in the session, the Bank of Japan released its “Summary of Opinions” from the April 30–May 1 policy meeting, with members emphasizing heightened uncertainty—particularly around U.S. trade policy. The tone underscored the Bank’s cautious stance, suggesting limited scope for near-term action until global developments stabilise. Since then, the U.S.-China trade talks have yielded a modest tariff rollback and a 90-day pause in new measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1183&quot; data-end=&quot;1379&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;BoJ Deputy Governor Uchida echoed the theme of uncertainty in separate remarks, but reiterated that the Bank still expects to raise rates gradually if the economy and inflation evolve as forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1381&quot; data-end=&quot;1596&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In China, the yuan strengthened after the People’s Bank of China set the daily USD/CNY reference rate below 7.2 for the first time since April 7, signalling support for currency stability amid easing trade tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1598&quot; data-end=&quot;1817&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Australian data offered a slightly improved but still cautious tone. Consumer confidence edged higher from previous lows, while business confidence ticked up modestly. Business conditions, however, slipped on the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1819&quot; data-end=&quot;1898&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Elsewhere in FX, major currency pairs excluding the yen traded in tight ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Santos, Brazil’s main port for exports to China, is struggling with capacity and infrastructure.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Brazil’s fertilizer supply issues and soil nutrient depletion pose challenges to increased crop production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I speculated earlier on this, it seems pretty obvious.

                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan deputy governor Uchida:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;US tariffs put downward pressure on Japan’s economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are both upside, downside risks from US tariffs on Japan’s prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan’s economic growth to slow to around potential before accelerating again as overseas growth resumes moderate growth path&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan’s output gap to remain around current levels, after which it will resume improvement toward end of BOJ’s 3-year projection period through fiscal 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like Uchida is uncertain of where to go with policy from here? At least in the near to medium term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahh, here is some more, a little more confident on hikes now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BOJ expected to keep raising interest rates if economy, prices improve as we project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan’s underlying inflation, medium- and long-term inflation expectations will likely stagnate temporarily&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But even during that period, wages are expected to continue rising as Japan’s job market very tight, firms likely to continue passing on rising labour costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once global economy resumes uptrend, Japan’s economy likely to recover and heighten underlying inflation, inflation expectations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty surrounding our forecasts is extremely high, so we will determine without pre-conception whether our forecasts will materialise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong yen has negative impact on exports, big manufacturers’ profits but improves households’ real income and pushes up retailers’ profits via falling import costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid FX moves make it difficult for firms to set business plans, heighten uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, USD/JPY has dribbled lower since Kato&apos;s verbal intervention efforts a little while ago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/japan-finance-minister-kato-wants-to-discuss-fx-with-bessent-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Japan finance minister Kato wants to discuss FX with Bessent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-rate today is the strongest (for CNY) since April 7. It&apos;s the first setting below 7.2 since that date also. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous close was 7.2075&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;more to come &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBOC injected 180bn yuan via 7-day reverse repos at 1.40%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;405bn yuan mature today

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news ICYMI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/forexlive-americas-fx-news-wrap-massive-across-the-board-on-trade-war-relief-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Forexlive Americas FX news wrap: Massive across the board on trade war relief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/forexlive-european-fx-news-wrap-us-china-strike-deal-to-lower-tariffs-after-talks-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ForexLive European FX news wrap: US, China strike deal to lower tariffs after talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan Summary of Opinions at the Monetary Policy Meeting on April 30 and May 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/opinion_2025/opi250501.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;full text is here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines via Reuters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: BOJ likely to keep raising interest rates in accordance with improvements in economy, prices
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: No change to BOJ’s rate-hike stance as real interest rates deeply negative but must scrutinise risks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: Uncertainty surrounding economy, price outlook high, likelihood of achieving price goal not as high as in past&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: BoJ has little choice but to take wait-and-see stance until developments surrounding U.S. trade policy stabilise to some extent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: BoJ will enter temporary pause in rate hikes but shouldn’t slide into excessive pessimism, must guide policy nimbly and flexibly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: Chance of Japan’s underlying inflation faltering is small&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: U.S. trade policy development could turn positive or negative any time, which means BOJ’s policy path could change any time as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: Our projections have been severely jolted by US trade policy with higher US tariffs likely to weigh on Japan’s economy, prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: Must be mindful of upside risks to prices if global supply chains are disrupted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One member said: From long-term perspective, U.S. tariff policy and ensuing uncertainty likely won’t affect Japan’s underlying inflation, potential growth rate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting all of this together it appears the BoJ is intent on hiking rates, but the question is when. Given the developments over the weekend, is the 90-day trim-and-pause with China enough to give the BoJ confidence to hike?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;The Bank of Japan (BOJ) releases a &quot;Summary of Opinions&quot; after each monetary policy meeting. It serves as a record of the discussion and views of the Policy Board members on various economic and financial issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key points about the Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary includes the views of the Policy Board members on economic conditions, both domestically and globally. This includes assessments of economic growth, inflation, and employment trends, among other indicators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary also outlines the Policy Board members&apos; views on the effectiveness of the BOJ&apos;s current monetary policy measures, including interest rate policy, asset purchases, and yield curve control. Members may discuss the pros and cons of these policies and their potential impact on the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary includes discussions on the outlook for monetary policy and the potential risks to the economy. Board members may express their views on the appropriate timing and direction of future policy changes, as well as the potential impact of external factors such as global economic conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary also includes any dissenting views among the Policy Board members. If a member disagrees with the majority view on a particular issue, they may express their own opinion and rationale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a few week&apos;s time we&apos;ll get the Minutes of this meeting. The Minutes are a more detailed record of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;text-align-start vertical-align-baseline&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Minutes include a more complete record of the views expressed, including any dissents or alternative opinions that may not be included in the summary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is typically released a few days after the policy meeting, while the Minutes are published about a month later. This means that the Summary of Opinions can provide more up-to-date information on the BOJ&apos;s current stance and view on the economy and monetary policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is usually written in a more accessible language, making it easier to understand the BOJ&apos;s views on monetary policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Minutes, on the other hand, are often more technical and may require a deeper understanding of economics and financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Summary of Opinions is typically shorter than the Minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America analysts suggest that Monday’s market rally, sparked by news of a U.S.-China tariff agreement, may reflect the so-called “Trump put” — the notion that Trump will act to limit stock market declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; “The recent news flow on trade suggests that de-escalation is likely to continue.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Trump put is alive and well.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The administration is incentivised to avoid a recession, and more trade deals are likely forthcoming.”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts go on to day that despite recent deals with China and the U.K., the 10% baseline tariff introduced on April 2 is “likely here to stay.” That view was echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said Sunday that the baseline tariff is expected “to be in place for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are very forgiving. They&apos;ll punish you for stuffing things up, but if you move to fix it, all is forgiven! Tariffs are still the highest since WW2 so there is still some work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) U.S. POSTS $258B APRIL BUDGET SURPLUS, UP 23%

Strong tax payments and record import tariffs boosted the U.S. April surplus to $258B, Treasury reported.

🔸 $16B in customs duties, up $9B from last year.
🔸 U.S. collected $500M/day from tariffs, far below Trump&apos;s $2B/day claim.
🔸 Tariff revenue will fall as U.S.-China agreed to cut tariffs (U.S. to 30%, China to 10%) for 90 days.

For fiscal 2025 (Oct-Apr):

🔸 Deficit: $1.049T, up 23%.
🔸 Receipts: $3.11T, Outlays: $4.16T — both April records.
🔸 Adjusted for timing effects, the deficit rose 4%.</title>

      <title>(My Local Feed) CHINA TRADE EASING DOESN&apos;T MEAN A QUICK FED CUT: DEUTSCHE BANK

A big drop in U.S.-China trade barriers lessens the prospects of a serious inflationary supply crunch. Even so, inflation remains stubborn enough that the Fed probably still won&apos;t be in a rush to cut interest rates, economists at Deutsche Bank write. Despite the trade war&apos;s easing, &quot;policies are likely to keep inflation at uncomfortably high levels for the Fed,&quot; Deutsche&apos;s team suggests. &quot;This announcement therefore reinforces our view that the Fed is going to be slow to cut rates this year.&quot; Deutsche&apos;s baseline assumption is that the Fed&apos;s next rate cut won&apos;t come before December</title>
