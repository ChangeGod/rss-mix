                            &lt;p&gt;The USDCAD has moved higher in response to the lower China/US tariffs (or suspension of the tariffs) and the overall USD buying. The price has risen toward a cluse or MAs, swing and retracement targets starting with the: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;200 are moving average on the 4-hour chart at 1.39874.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 200 day moving average of 1.40106,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swing area between 1.4009 and 1.40268, and the &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;38.2% retracement of the move down from the March high. That level comes in at 1.40525&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high price has reached 1.39983 and is waffling above the high price from March 15 at 1.3977, and the overhead resistance near the aforementioned technical targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, I go through the technical clues that are driving this currency pair. Be aware. Be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump is set to talk about pharma at a press conference imminently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President wrote yesterday about a plan for prescription drugs that would shift costs to other countries. That has pharma companies struggling against a very strong tape today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much in the way of macro drivers in the pharma-specific comments but Trump will surely be asked about China so watch out for those comments.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;87&quot; data-end=&quot;226&quot;&gt;The USDCHF has made a notable technical breakout, moving above a key consolidation area and extending higher toward retracement resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;228&quot; data-end=&quot;511&quot;&gt;On the hourly chart, the price had been confined within a red-box consolidation zone, capped by resistance near 0.8333. After several failed attempts, the pair finally broke above the top of that box and found support on a retest, using the 0.8333 level as a base to push higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;513&quot; data-end=&quot;794&quot;&gt;On the 4-hour chart (see chart below), the pair surged into a key swing area between 0.8373 and 0.84087, which also includes the 200-bar moving average, currently near 0.8383. The price broke above the area with momentum today.  This zone is now a critical support area and represents close risk for buyers looking to maintain the bullish momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;796&quot; data-end=&quot;1017&quot;&gt;To the upside, the next major resistance comes at the 38.2% retracement of the move down from the January high, which is being tested near 0.84823. A move above this level would open the door for further upside extension and represents the minimum retracement target to get to and through if the buyers are to take more control. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1019&quot; data-end=&quot;1031&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1032&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1032&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1034&quot; data-end=&quot;1090&quot;&gt;Breakout above hourly range high at 0.8333, now support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1091&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1093&quot; data-end=&quot;1164&quot;&gt;Support zone: 0.8373–0.84087 (includes 200-bar MA on 4-hour at 0.8383).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1165&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1167&quot; data-end=&quot;1208&quot;&gt;Resistance: 38.2% retracement at 0.84823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1209&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1211&quot; data-end=&quot;1272&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;A hold above the 4-hour swing area support keeps the bias tilted higher, but getting above the 38.2% retracement is a required target for the buyers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Gold is being put to the test today</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/news/gold-is-being-put-to-the-test-today-20250512/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:00:38 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/news/gold-is-being-put-to-the-test-today-20250512/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;There are many winners in today&apos;s market action but there is a big loser as well: Gold. It&apos;s down $95 to $3228 today as the great decoupling may not happen after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news looks bad for gold but I&apos;m carefully watching the technicals. Gold has so far held the May 1 low of $3201 and that&apos;s a good sign for the bulls. We&apos;ve seen some heavy gold selling in the New York 9 am hour through the equity open in the past year so I think that&apos;s a delicate time. If it can hold here and if Trump strikes a less-aggressive tone on the trade war then I think we can see a deeper selloff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-05-09/wall-street-balanced-between-bulls-bears-and-fence-main-street-maintains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kitco News&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and laid out how I was thinking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, said it&apos;s tough not to be bullish on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitco.com/charts/gold&quot;&gt;gold &lt;/a&gt;these days, but the de-escalation between the United States and China has the potential to sap the yellow metal’s momentum.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The meeting this weekend is high stakes,” he said. “People are saying 50%, then Trump&apos;s saying 80% today. We’ve built in some expectation of lower tariffs between China and the U.S., and it’s tough to judge how much is priced in and what might be the effect. If we come out of the weekend at 50%, I think we&apos;re going to see gold sell off and we&apos;ll see the riskier assets continue [higher].”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I don&apos;t think 50% would be the end goal, but it would be pretty rapid progress and a nice sign for both sides.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Button said that gold is acting as the best financial barometer of the state of global trade these days. “Gold is clearly now finding itself as a trade on global trade, a ‘trade-war-on/trade-war-off’ asset,” he said. “For the week ahead, if China tariffs come down, if U.S. tariffs come down… I think that you don&apos;t have a meeting without a plan to offer something, so they’ve both ratcheted down a little bit. I think any progress in that direction is negative for gold for the week ahead.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I would say gold looks to be carving out a range at the top end,” Button added. “If you pull back, gold went from $2,500 to $3,500 in a straight line, and now it&apos;s consolidating in a $300 range at the top without a really big pullback. This is the best the bulls could hope for. It was nice to talk about $4,000 or $10,000 or whatever, but if gold can spend a month or two right around these levels, that&apos;s bullish long term.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China are down to 30% while China tariffs on the US are set at 10%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the massive cut in tariffs, 20 percentage points of the US tariffs on China are due to fentanyl and I think there is a path to lowering or eliminating that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is for 90 days but Treasury Secretary Bessent said that could be extended so long as negotiations are headed in the right direction. I think that leaves importers in a tough spot as they will have to decide on whether to stockpile with 30% tariffs or risk a better/worse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now though, there is a huge sigh of relief in markets with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures up 3.2%, oil up 4%, USD/JPY up 280 pips and 2-year yields up 11 bps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message there is that US, Chinese and global growth prospects just got much better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is a test: Can these moves be sustained or is there still some skepticism? That will tell us about the underlying strength of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you have to be optimistic here as it looks like Trump doesn&apos;t have the appetite for a trade war after all and he&apos;s pivoting toward opening up China for US companies. Was the Trump Put in all along?&lt;/p&gt;

So, that means the US is still imposing 30% tariffs on China while China is imposing 10% tariffs on the US during this 90-day pause period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That said, the agreement today will not cover the de minimis exemption that was abolished as of 2 May and China is also still keeping their restriction on rare earth exports in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;US Treasury secretary Bessent had a lot to say during the session, reaffirming that the new mechanism in place for discussions will facilitate much calmer discussions and actions between both sides. He made sure markets know that the mechanism &quot;will avoid the type of escalation&quot; from last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar and risk trades rallied on the news unsurprisingly and held gains throughout. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were already up 1.5% before doubling gains to be up 3% now. Nasdaq futures are up 3.8% and poised to reenter a bull market again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for the dollar, the gains were solid across the board. USD/JPY jumped up by a good 300 pips at the highs today, extending gains from around 146.20 to above 148.00 now on the day. Meanwhile, EUR/USD is down over 1% to 1.1100 and GBP/USD also down 1% to 1.3175 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, USD/CAD is up slightly by 0.3% and nudging closer to 1.4000 while AUD/USD is down 0.4% to 0.6390 after some stubbornness following the initial headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, bond yields are also racing higher on the optimism as markets pare back rate cut bets as well. Oil is a strong beneficiary as it climbs up by 4% to $63.50. And gold is one of the bigger casualties in all this, down over 3% to $3,224 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The United States and China have agreed to a 90-day suspension of their tariffs, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut duties on American imports from 125% to 10%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides committed to continuing negotiations, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasizing a mutual interest in avoiding full economic decoupling. China will also suspend countermeasures, including export restrictions on rare earth materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the truce breaks a damaging impasse that halted many cross-border orders, the deal lacks concrete commitments from China on currency or trade imbalances, prompting skepticism about its long-term durability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is will the suspension lead to more businesses scrambling to take advantage of the temporary tariff relief, pushing up transport costs and inflation in the process (30% is still a BIG jump in costs), or will the 30% still be a game changer (i.e., still too high). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treas. Sec. Bessent is making the rounds and stated that the U.S. is aiming for a strategic decoupling from China in critical sectors such as steel, semiconductors, and select medicines to safeguard national interests. He noted that China now appears serious about stemming the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and that both sides have established a mechanism to avoid further tariff escalation. Despite the decoupling goals, Bessent emphasized that the U.S. still wants American businesses to be able to sell into the Chinese market. He confirmed that significant progress was made during two days of talks and hinted that further meetings with Chinese counterparts are likely in the coming weeks, with future discussions expected to focus on non-tariff trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, President Trump also announced plans to reinstate his &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot; policy aimed at reducing prescription drug costs by tying U.S. prices to those in the lowest-paying countries. The original rule, finalized in 2020, targeted Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctors’ offices but was blocked by courts and later revoked by President Biden. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed the new executive order—set to be signed Monday—would cut drug prices by 30% to 80%, though specific details on which drugs or payments would be affected remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are sharply higher on all the news, with the futures implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures implying a gain of 1026 points. On Friday the index fell -119.11 or -0.29%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures implying a gain of 172 109 points. On Friday the index fell -4.03 points or -0.07%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures implying a gain of 790 points. On Friday the index was unchanged &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, +0.53% (traded to a new record today)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, +1.37%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, +0.49%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, +0.56% (highest level since 2008)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, +1.78% (highest level since 2007)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are higher &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.93%, +10.0 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.090%, +10.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.451%, +7.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.81%, +4.9 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil up $2.50 or 4.0% to $63.54&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver is and $0.44 or -1.33% to $32.27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is down $108 or -3.26% to $3217.79&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up $164 at $104,293. On Friday the price closed at $102,991.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump viewed 80% as not being an embargo for China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can always go back to 2 April level i.e. 54% tariffs for China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees a phone call taking place before any meeting between Trump and Xi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The current timeline for the status quo is 90 days. So, better get on it. But as mentioned, the 90 days is pretty much just an initial timeline. Unless talks implode between both sides, that can always be readjusted to a longer timeline. The question is if the can continues to be kicked down the road for long enough, will Trump lose patience?&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current tariffs level is a floor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, we have a process in place to avoid further escalation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This at least clears things up a bit on their current position at least. As a reminder, the US is now putting a 10% base level tariffs plus 20% tariffs due to the fentanyl issue (30% total) on China. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-china-deal-reportedly-does-not-cover-de-minimis-exemption-for-e-commerce-shipments-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;the de minimis exemption will not be restored&lt;/a&gt; as well even with the climb down. Meanwhile, China is putting a 10% base level tariffs on the US and have not pulled back on restricting rare earth exports from before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-china-halts-rare-earth-exports-after-new-controls-raising-global-supply-concerns-20250413/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;While China is also acknowledging the positive steps taken in seeking a trade deal, the nuance in how either the US or China is selling the narrative is also something important to be wary about. On paper, sure there are things to be optimistic as both sides seek de-escalation. However, the undertone is what will set the stage for further discussions and how fruitful that can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The US so far have pushed the narrative that both sides managed to see eye to eye in talks over the weekend. And that China has finally understood the US&apos; position on fentanyl and will do something about that. In the meantime, Bessent has been harping on the supposed mechanism for both sides to continue discussions moving forward. And he made sure markets know that with such a mechanism, retaliatory tariffs of the kind we saw last month will be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But how is China viewing all this instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;China&apos;s commerce ministry dubbed the deal as an &quot;important step&quot; in resolving the differences between the two countries via dialogue and consultation. Adding that it lays the groundwork for further cooperation. Note, there&apos;s no mention of fentanyl talks whatsoever here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And hours later, the message from the state media is making it clear how they see the situation as being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;This shows that China&apos;s firm countermeasures and resolute stance have been very effective. The countermeasures have had a material impact on the US and the US administration have reduced tariffs to the base level i.e. 10% after the talks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, the commerce ministry also made sure to note that its restriction on rare earth exports will still be in place regardless of the agreement today. In case you missed it, this is related to the announcement last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-china-halts-rare-earth-exports-after-new-controls-raising-global-supply-concerns-20250413/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;All this is not to say that there&apos;s two sides to the story though. At least this time around, the narratives from both sides are lining up much, much closer together than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, it is evident that China is more reserved and cautiously optimistic. That said, optimistic is still optimistic especially after the height of tensions last month. And the joint statement today, which is a rarity on its own, reflects that as both sides are putting on a show to seek de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For just choosing to sit down and talk, China has definitely gotten a major concession from Trump. So, it&apos;s arguably clear who blinked first in this scenario. But at this point, it doesn&apos;t really matter who did. Egos aside, the development is a positive for markets and the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But in the bigger picture, can this be followed up by more positive correspondence and eventually an actual trade deal down the road? Or is this going to be the new normal with the US seeking sectoral tariffs/decoupling from China? We&apos;ll see in time.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are going to protect our steel, semiconductor industries, selected medicines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Believe China is now serious about halting fentanyl flows into the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a mechanism in place to avoid upwards tariffs pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We want American businesses to be able to sell to China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I imagine we will meet (with China) again in the next few weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We got a lot done over two days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will see what we can do on non-tariff barriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Well, earlier in the day he said that neither side are interested in decoupling. So, yeah. In any case, any real intentions will be buried by the wave of optimism across markets right now as both sides seek de-escalation. But for China, they certainly got a lot out of it by just deciding to sit down for a chat. Either way, it&apos;s still a positive for markets and the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Market Sentiment Snapshot for Traders and Investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s financial markets are experiencing significant shifts driven primarily by the recent U.S.-China agreement on tariff reductions. Here is a detailed overview of the current sentiment across key financial instruments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold (Bearish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold prices have dropped sharply, with futures plunging about 3%. This bearish momentum is largely a result of improved sentiment stemming from U.S.-China tariff cuts, reducing gold&apos;s attractiveness as a traditional safe-haven asset. Traders should monitor if uncertainties around these trade agreements resurface, potentially stabilizing or reversing gold&apos;s bearish trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLD HAS CROSSED DOWN 3320... But if it crosses above it, then we may have a dip in gold!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil (Bullish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices are strongly bullish, rising between 2% to over 3% today. Positive trade developments between the U.S. and China are fueling optimism for global economic growth and increased oil demand. However, the potential for higher crude oil oversupply due to increased OPEC production remains a notable risk that traders should watch closely, as it could temper current gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (Bullish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. equity markets are firmly bullish, with stock futures significantly higher. This positive sentiment is primarily due to easing U.S.-China tensions and expectations of improved trade conditions. Investors are cautiously optimistic, awaiting further details to assess the sustainability of this rally. Equity investors should maintain vigilance for any signs of stalled trade progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch ES 5882 today... If we get there, profit takers may stop in. TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK ONLY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Dollar Index (Bullish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar has surged to a one-month high, driven by the improving global growth outlook linked to U.S.-China tariff relief. The bullish sentiment is strong, but the market acknowledges that maintaining this momentum depends on continued progress in trade negotiations. Currency traders should watch for developments closely, as any negative shifts could swiftly impact the dollar’s current strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese Yen (Bearish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen is notably bearish today, experiencing significant selling pressure as investors pivot away from safe-haven currencies in favor of riskier assets amid reduced geopolitical tensions. The positive U.S.-China tariff developments have significantly diminished the yen&apos;s attractiveness, placing additional downward pressure on the currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro (Bearish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUR/USD has experienced considerable bearish pressure, breaking below key support and eyeing further declines towards the 1.09 handle. The euro’s weakness largely stems from the strengthened dollar. However, traders note that further downside may be limited, given the potential uplift in global economic sentiment from recent trade agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro futures CROSSED DOWN 1.1118... But if it crosses above it, then we may have a dip in Euro!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies (Bullish)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies, led notably by Ethereum (ETH), are seeing a strong bullish sentiment. ETH has gained approximately 42% in the past five days, driven by improved investor optimism from U.S.-China tariff cuts and an overall increase in risk appetite. The crypto market broadly reflects this positive sentiment, indicating confidence in continued bullish momentum in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If bitcoin futures reaches 103,500 (retracing down to there), then bulls may buy again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlations and Market Dynamics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk-On Sentiment: The simultaneous rise in stocks, the US dollar, cryptocurrencies, and oil underscores strong &quot;risk-on&quot; market sentiment driven by U.S.-China trade optimism. This is negatively impacting traditional safe-haven assets like gold and yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inverse Correlation (Gold vs. Stocks &amp;amp; Crypto): Gold’s bearishness directly corresponds with bullish equity and cryptocurrency sentiment, as traders shift away from defensive positions to riskier assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dollar Strength vs. Euro and Yen Weakness: The robust US dollar rally directly pressures the euro and yen, highlighting their inverse correlation with risk-positive developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actionable Insights for traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders and investors should remain adaptive, closely tracking updates from ongoing U.S.-China negotiations. Immediate bullish or bearish biases can swiftly shift, depending on trade-related news. Keeping an eye on further details and potential reversals will be crucial in managing risk and capturing opportunities in the current dynamic market environment. Watch some of the tips above for possible hints for the end of the moves, and possible trades... at your own risk only.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US-China deal reportedly does not cover de minimis exemption for e-commerce shipments</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The de minimis exemption is a rule which allowed for certain e-commerce shipments of goods at $800 or less to enter duty-free. The $800 is the threshold amount so to speak. Any shipments below that will not incur import charges basically. This allowed a supposed &quot;loophole&quot; for online retailers - particularly fast fashion from China - to have a stronger presence in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This exemption was removed by the White House last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-closes-de-minimis-exemptions-to-combat-chinas-role-in-americas-synthetic-opioid-crisis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And it looks like even with the trade deal announced today, that&apos;s not going to fall back into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So, in any case, online shopping from overseas will definitely be much more expensive for US consumers regardless of the deal today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If you head over to the DHL sub-Reddit in the past two weeks, you can already see how much of a pain tariffs have become for US consumers. There&apos;s been countless cases of duties charged being much more than the entire item/product ordered itself. It goes to show where the pain really lies when it comes to tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There was already the opening gap higher from early today as Trump floated &quot;a very good&quot; meeting with China over the weekend. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were up 1.5% before doubling gains to be up by roughly 3% now. That comes after the joint statement by both sides, confirming the lowering of tariffs by 115% for 90 days as they seek further talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Since then, it&apos;s been quite straightforward trading on the session. There&apos;s not much let up in the optimism as equities continue to hold close to the highs. In Europe, the DAX is up 1.0% while the CAC 40 is up 1.4% as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for FX, the dollar is also sitting at the highs for the day. EUR/USD is down 1.4% to 1.1090 while USD/JPY is up over 2% to 148.45 currently. Even AUD/USD has turned negative on the day with the pair down 0.4% to 0.6390 currently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EURUSD broke through the key support and it&apos;s now eyeing the 1.09 handle</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The US Dollar has been taking it on the chin for a few months now and eventually it became one of the most crowded trades. In such instances, you should start to get wary and look for inflection points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I&apos;ve been highlighting that positive news on the trade front would have likely boosted the greenback in the short-term because of overstretched positioning. When you are at such overstretched levels, as soon as conditions change, the repricing can lead to meaningful corrections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the US Dollar is now driven by the hawkish repricing in interest rates expectations. At the peak of the trade war fears, the market went to price in as far as five rate cuts by the end of 2025, and now following the US-China news, we are down to just two rate cuts (which was the Fed&apos;s base case in December 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the best case scenario I&apos;ve outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-best-case-scenario-for-the-us-dollar-is-playing-out-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We should see further gains for the greenback as the market might even start to doubt the need for two rate cuts, but for that, stronger economic data might be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that we recently broke through the key support zone around the 1.1277 level where we had also the major trendline for confluence. We retested the breakout before opening lower today and then extending the move to the downside as the US-China news hit. The next key levels are the 1.10 and 1.09 handles, but I can see the swing low around the 1.09 being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see the strong move to the downside following the US-China news. That was the time to sell as we might not get a good pullback after such a surprising news. Remember that the market&apos;s reaction is stronger when it gets surprised. If we do get a pullback though, we should find sellers around the minor downward trendline near the 1.12 handle. If the price breaks higher, then the buyers could take the price to the next resistance around the 1.1277 level. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;One of the main Trump&apos;s goals has been bringing long term interest rates down. The focus was on reducing the deficit because it impacted the long term premium.  We&apos;ve heard many times talks of the US being on an &quot;unsustainable path&quot; and in the long-run that leads to either higher taxes or higher &quot;money printing&quot;. For this reason, buyers of US debt could demand higher interest rates for the perceived future risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-term interest rates are determined by the central bank policy but long term rates are determined by the market. For long term interest rates, the market takes into account three main factors: future central bank policy, inflation expectations and future supply and demand of Treasury debt issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s &quot;strategic uncertainty&quot; to negotiate trade barriers kind of halted the momentum in economic activity that we&apos;ve had before this whole tariffs saga begun. As we now price in better and better conditions for global growth (as the super high tariffs get brought down), the economic activity will likely start to accelerate and the higher demand could keep inflation higher for longer and take rate cuts off the table again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might keep the downside in long term yields limited and lead to higher rates in the second half of 2025 before seeing them rolling over and this time making a new low. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s a graphical depiction of the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Trump&apos;s statements about buying stocks in the last few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And now, markets are rallying further as the US and China lower tariffs in favour of discussions - at least for the next 90 days. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures up over 2.5% on the day, we&apos;re slated to open just above the 5,800 mark. If that holds, Trump&apos;s message from Thursday last week will again yield another positive follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And if you really took to his first message of it being &quot;THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!&quot; before the reciprocal tariffs pause announcement, the return would&apos;ve been roughly 16% as we get to the open later today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Latest US-China discussions are good news, if reports are accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Progress on domestic inflation, not US tariffs, was the main factor behind my rate vote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade policy uncertainty will continue until there&apos;s a permanent solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK GDP data is volatile, makes it hard to gauge if weakness is due to demand or supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US-China news is without a doubt the news of the day and most likely of the week. They brought down tariffs by much more than expected, so that&apos;s a positive for global growth expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could end up fuelling some inflation in the short-term, so that&apos;s going to be something to watch out for because it could force the central banks to take a longer pause on rate adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

milestone for VIP Tier 1 are instantly upgraded, unlocking a 25% discount on
Crypto Futures and CFD trading costs. The tier status remains locked for 30
days but can still be upgraded to VIP Tier 2, offering a 40% discount on Crypto
Futures and a 50% discount on CFD trading costs, once the trading volume criteria
is met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PrimeXBT, the introduction of VIP Tiers gives
traders a clear and motivating way to lower trading costs the more they trade.
