                            &lt;p&gt;I have been speaking loud about the 1.1271 – 1.1275 area in the EURUSD as a key level for the buyers and sellers (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/the-eurusdgbpusd-has-seen-up-and-down-trading-the-usdjpy-is-in-risk-on-mode-what-next-20250501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;post here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level corresponds with the swing high from 2023, and the 61.8% retracement of the move down from the 2020 high to the 2022 low (not shown). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move below that area and the bias shifts more in favor of the sellers. Stay above and the buyers remain more in control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price has move below that level to a low price of 1.12651. However, there has still been some stall. The reason is the low price from April 15 also bottomed at that area. The 38.2% retracement of the move up from the March 27 low comes in at 1.12505.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sellers, the hope is that the bounce off of the low price from April 15 is modest and the momentum to the downside continues to and through 1.1265 and then 1.1250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dip buyers, they would want to see price back above 1.13072 which were swing low levels from April 23. Above that 1.13287 would need to be breached.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Q1 GDP was released this week, leading to new estimates for Q2 from the Atlanta Fed GDPNow growth model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first estimate yesterday, it forecasts a 2.4% growth rate. Today, that story is different with the estimate now at 1.1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the data releases happen, volatility in the index can be quite substantial especially at the start of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their own words for today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2025 is 1.1 percent on May 1, down from 2.4 percent on April 30. After this morning’s releases from the US Census Bureau and the Institute for Supply Management, the nowcast of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and real private fixed investment growth fell from 3.3 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, to 1.9 percent and -0.7 percent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next GDPNow update is Tuesday, May 6. Please see the &quot;Release Dates&quot; tab below for a list of upcoming releases.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s an impressive day for the US dollar as the Dollar Index breaks above 100 with a broad bid. The chart here looks like something of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern that targets a rise to 102.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is beginning to shift away from recessionary pricing and Fed cuts. A June cut is still high at 66% but that&apos;s slide today while pricing for the year ahead is down to 122 bps from 131 bps yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yield curve is validating the move as well with 2-year yields up 5 bps to 3.67% from a low of 3.56% earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar bids are getting help from the tech trade as money piles back into the Nasdaq following strong earnings from Microsoft and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a delicate balancing act here because tariffs are still out there and the US and China are effectively embargoing each other. The market is pricing in a trade war climb down but to what level? And no one really knows the effects on the real economy. That said, you could argue that companies like MSFT and META are basically immune.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, this area represents a major decision point for buyers and sellers alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;418&quot; data-end=&quot;695&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, price action is moving away from a previously stubborn swing area between 163.20 and 163.35 (see green numbered circles), which now acts as a near-term support zone. The bullish tilt is further reinforced by the pair pulling away from its cluster of moving averages, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;696&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;696&quot; data-end=&quot;716&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;698&quot; data-end=&quot;716&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100-day MA at 161.056 (the price has been above that MA since April 10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;717&quot; data-end=&quot;752&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;719&quot; data-end=&quot;752&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 200-day MA at 161.375 (above since April 23)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;753&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;755&quot; data-end=&quot;820&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 100 and 200 bar MAs on the 4-hour chart around 162.05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;822&quot; data-end=&quot;1028&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum is shifting toward buyers as the technical backdrop improves. A break above 164.17 would open the door to further upside potential, while holding below keeps the pair locked in broad consolidation and the sellers in play, but it would taka a move back below 163.20 to 163.35 swing area. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1030&quot; data-end=&quot;1054&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1055&quot; data-end=&quot;1212&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1055&quot; data-end=&quot;1132&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1057&quot; data-end=&quot;1132&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 164.07–164.17 (multi-month ceiling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1133&quot; data-end=&quot;1212&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1135&quot; data-end=&quot;1212&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 163.35, 163.20 (swing area), then 162.05 area (start of MA cluster). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&apos;Buy America&apos; is the theme as the market anticipates some kind of trade deal to be announced later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s led to strong US dollar bids across the board that have accelerated in the last hour. In addition, stock markets are at the highs of the day with the S&amp;amp;P 500 up 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 2.4%. After falling into negative territory pre-market, the Russell 2000 is up 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from trade, one thing that could be driving bids is the tone from Congress around the big tax cut message. It&apos;s tough to trust a politician but all the comments have been positive and upbeat. I think the flipside is that it will come with a huge budget deficit because that seems to be the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it&apos;s not truly a &apos;Buy America&apos; theme as bonds are selling off today. Bessent earlier highlighted falling 2-year yields but those have reversed course and are now up 3 bps and up 10 bps from the lows. We&apos;ve also seen Fed cut pricing in the year ahead come in by 6 bps.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/2waytvapp/status/1917933048311501266&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;about Waltz came out a few hours ago and now CBS is reporting that he&apos;s out along with deputy Alex Wong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial report says US Special Envoy to the Middle East could be Steve Witkoff who has been negotiating with Russia and Iran. The again, there was a hit on Witkoff just yesterday&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/04/30/us-news/steve-witkoff-shouldnt-be-leading-iran-russia-negotiations-allies-and-insiders-say/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; in the New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s expected to be announced on the weekend but that timeline could change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could also help to explain why US-Iran negotiations scheduled for this weekend were delayed. Waltz retired from the army reserve stepped down from Congress in January to take the job. He replaced Jake Sullivan who was Biden&apos;s National Security Advisor for his entire term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had 8 advisors in the role in his first term, starting with Michael Flynn.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview: Tech Sector Shines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market is dominated by a strong performance in the technology sector. Behemoths like Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significant gains, up by an impressive 8.86%. This rally is fueled by investor optimism and strong earnings reports. Oracle (ORCL) also sees a notable rise of 5.17%, affirming robust confidence in software infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor sector contributes positively, with Nvidia (NVDA) experiencing an upward movement of 4.08%. This comeback is largely driven by innovative breakthroughs and strategic partnerships that buoys investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Qualcomm (QCOM) suffers a steep decline of 8.20%, indicating specific company challenges or disappointing news affecting investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends: Positive Tech Vibes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching mood in today&apos;s market is one of cautious optimism, primarily fueled by exceptional performances within the tech industry. There&apos;s a visible investor shift towards tech stocks, as evident from the strong performance by stalwarts like Nvidia and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, some sectors like healthcare are facing downward pressure, with Lilly (LLY) dropping by 6.54%, possibly due to negative news or earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication services also remain positive, with Meta (META) showing a strong gain of 5.23%, signaling continued robustness in digital ad spending and platform engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations: Focus on Tech, Caution in Healthcare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors might capitalize on the flourishing tech sector, considering the solid performance and growth potential in recent sessions. Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft deserve focused attention for those keen on technology investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, caution is advised in the healthcare sector, especially with companies like Lilly struggling currently. Monitoring upcoming reports and broader market cues could provide more clarity soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For diversification, consider the energy sector, with companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) showing a modest gain of 0.94%. The sector offers a stable yet growth-oriented investment avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders and investors should visit &lt;a href=&apos;https://www.forexlive.com&apos;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for up-to-date market analysis and financial insights to stay ahead of market shifts and opportunities. Diversification across these prominent sectors could prove beneficial in navigating today&apos;s mixed market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continued its move to the upside after breaking above the 100-hour moving average at 0.82556. That level became a springboard for buyers, who stepped in and pushed the pair higher during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;486&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier in the week, the 200-hour moving average (green line) provided support, helping to form a base for the current rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;488&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next key resistance area comes in between 0.83184 and 0.8333—the highs from Monday and Friday. Just above that sits the 38.2% retracement of the April decline, which comes in at 0.8350. This creates a major target and decision area for traders. Getting above the 38.2% after a trend move is required to show the buyers are willing to take more control. It is the minimum retracement target.  Absent a break of it, the buyers are not winning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;488&quot; data-end=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, the technical optics are more positive with support at the 200 earlier this week, and support at the 100 hour MA today, showing buying interest.  There is work to do, but the buyers are making a play. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are at the heart of the trade war and today&apos;s ISM survey of the industry gave the market some solace: Orders aren&apos;t collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that with largely upbeat commentary from corporates as Q1 earnings roll out and the world is feeling better about the tariff war. I&apos;d caution that could be premature but there are also indications that Trump is backing off on the trade war as the US calls China and gets set to announce a deal later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is Friday&apos;s non-farm payrolls report and there could be some volatility there but I just don&apos;t see many companies talking about layoffs at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prelim was 50.7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior was 50.2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panelists noted an increased apprehension in product
markets, mainly around the future direction of US trade policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business confidence at 10 month low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; stocks of finished goods were reduced for a fifth
month in a row, and to the greatest degree of the year so far&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m surprised that inventories have been drawn down so deeply and it points to a rough hit from shortages than anticipated, and sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P
Global Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Manufacturing continued to flat-line in April amid
worrying downside risks to the outlook and sharply rising
costs.
&quot;Factory output fell for a second successive month as
tariffs were widely blamed on a slump in export orders
and curbed spending among customers more broadly
amid rising uncertainty.
&quot;Although the survey saw some producers report
evidence of beneficial tariff-related switching of
customer demand away from imports, any such sales
increase was countered by worries over tariff-related
disruptions to supply chains and lost export sales. This
served to drive business confidence about prospects
in the year ahead down sharply to the gloomiest for 10
months.
&quot;Concerns have also spiked in terms of input costs,
especially for imported materials and components, due
to the triple whammy of tariff-related price hikes, supply
shortages, and the weaker dollar.
&quot;Manufacturers are responding to these changing
demand, supply and cost conditions by raising their
selling prices and trimming headcounts to help protect
their margins.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EV sales down 39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hybrids up 29.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICE up 17.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting number because it shows that the race to beat the tariffs was real. That&apos;s going to create a bullwhip effect down the line and it shows a real effect on consumer behaviour. That&apos;s going to lead to a blockbuster April retail sales report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford shares are up 1% premarket, which puts them right back to where they were in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This was an interesting tease from Hassett on tariff deals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like the person in the middle of all that is Jamieson Greer and Howard Lutnick outside of China. And I&apos;m sure they&apos;re happy to talk to you about it; I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: So you don&apos;t know who is first or what is in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I think I know but I can&apos;t tease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC: You do think you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett: I do think I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect this will be an announcement of a deal with India, where there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/a-good-bet-on-what-the-country-is-that-is-near-a-trade-deal-with-the-usa-20250429/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;mounting signs&lt;/a&gt; of a deal. The contours of that will be key, particularly if the US is will to lower its tariff floor below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This is it? Are they going to unveil the first trade deal or at least the details? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that&apos;s the case, make sure to follow the news until the US market close as that would be HUGE for the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s clear that they can&apos;t go on with this trade war for too long as the economic damage would be big for both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The market appears to be coming around to the idea that the US economy is fine, or at least that it was fine before April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of upbeat commentary from Visa and the internals of yesterday&apos;s GDP report has the market thinking that the economy is on strong footing. The recent initial jobless claims numbers bear that out but that set will be tested again today. The consensus is 224K, up a touch from 222K a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then at 10 am ET, the focus will shift to the industrial economy with March construction spending and April ISM manufacturing. The latter is expected to slip to 48.0 from 49.0. Lately there has been a focus on the &apos;prices paid&apos; numbers as well but with oil prices cratering, the market is seeing more room for the Fed to cut rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI crude was last down $1.21 to $57.00.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;US stocks have moved higher led by sharp gains in Meta and Microsoft after the close yesterday. That has the USDJPY moving higher with a bit of risk on and dovish comments from BOJ Ueda.  The EURUSD and GBPUSD have seen down and up price action today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN this video, I take a technical look at the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD from a technical perspective and outline the key levels in play and explain why.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware. Be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

That is leading to markets thinking about a further pause on rates in June next, following the decision today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY nudged higher from 144.20 to 144.75 during the presser and is still largely holding gains, seen up 1% at 144.50 levels now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, there wasn&apos;t too much action in the FX space. The dollar is keeping steadier across the board, but mostly little changed against the other major currencies. EUR/USD is lightly down by 0.1% to 1.1320 but was hovering around 1.1300 at the tail end of Asia trading. Meanwhile, GBP/USD is flat at 1.3325 and USD/CAD just up slightly by 0.2% to 1.3823 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, US futures are keeping higher after the late rebound from Wall Street yesterday. And the mood is helped by a jump up in tech shares after stronger earnings from Meta and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;We had US Treasury secretary Bessent out with some remarks as well but nothing that is too meaningful, mainly just a repeat of what we&apos;ve heard before. It&apos;s now more about walking the walk, not talking the talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The bond market is also continuing to hold the calm, so that&apos;s keeping the risk mood in a better spot to start the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the commodities space, gold is pushed down as it breaks away from its recent consolidation. The $3,200 level is now eyed next amid the break from the short-term technical range over the past week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Oil was a bit of a standout mover as it dipped down to a low of $56.40 as concerns continue to grow on multiple fronts on the oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We expect to see GDP revised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP decline may have been due to inventory stocking of imports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US households consumption is strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yields below Federal Funds Rate is signal that the Fed should cut rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our policies will bring down inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bolded comment is a classic &quot;rule of thumb&quot; in the markets. When the 2 year yield falls below the FFR, it&apos;s a signal that the market views the tightening cycle over and expects the Fed to cut rates soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that it&apos;s based on markets expectations and they can be wrong at times. We saw that in 2023 when the 2 year yield has been below the FFR for a long time but then went all the way back to match the FFR. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 105,441 job cuts last month is 63% higher compared to the same month last year. That brings the year-to-date total to 602,493 layoffs now, which is the highest since 2020. For some context, the figure is some 87% higher compared to the first four months of 2024. It once again underscores the impact of the DOGE layoffs, with 281,452 of those job cuts being directly attributed to that.&lt;/p&gt;
