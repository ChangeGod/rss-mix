                            &lt;p&gt;ECB Excriva says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Euro&apos;s recent appreciation was a surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More difficult to predict how tariffs impact inflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;471&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A stronger currency tends to lower inflation. This happens because imported goods and services become cheaper in local currency terms, which reduces input costs for businesses and lowers prices for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;473&quot; data-end=&quot;830&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the same time, the cost of imports declines, making foreign goods more attractive to domestic consumers and businesses. This typically leads to an increase in import volumes. While this can benefit consumers through lower prices and more choices, it may widen the trade deficit if the increase in imports is not offset by a corresponding rise in exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the export side, a stronger currency makes domestic goods more expensive for foreign buyers. This reduces the competitiveness of a country’s exports in global markets, which can lead to a decline in export volumes, particularly for price-sensitive goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Higher tariffs on exported items suppress exported goods if the price of goods are passed onto the consumer.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Apple in serious trouble?</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/is-apple-in-serious-trouble-20250521/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 18:16:25 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/is-apple-in-serious-trouble-20250521/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, X (formerly Twitter),
Spotify, Match Group, and Epic Games, developer of Fortnite, objected to
Apple&apos;s plan to charge fees for payments made outside the App Store. Then, in
February this year, Beijing suddenly became interested in Apple&apos;s App Store
policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing a legal battle against Epic Games, Apple is
now obliged to allow developers to link to external payment methods, without
imposing fees or restrictions. Еhe story does not end here, as the company has
stated its intention to appeal the decision, but the process is obviously not
fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for Apple&apos;s profits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. App Store alone brought Apple more than $10
billion in revenue in 2024. Overall, the App Store generates about $20 billion
annually through commissions. Therefore, if other countries follow suit by
challenging Apple&apos;s practices, the impact on their profits could be even more
significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Apple will likely reconsider its commission policy
to avoid losing large and medium-sized companies. However, it is too early to
say that Apple is in serious trouble or that the second quarter will be a
disaster. Other gains, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2025/04/10/apple-iphone-panic-buying-reported-before-possible-price-rises---should-you-buy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;higher
iPhone prices&lt;/a&gt;, could offset losses in one area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest that the next generation of iPhones could
cost more, but this would be due to new features and design improvements rather
than &lt;a href=&quot;https://ceo.ca/@tradingview/its-tariffs-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;tariffs on imports from China&lt;/a&gt; (where
iPhones are assembled) or potential losses from lower App Store fees. It
certainly sounds implausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a good time for Apple product fans to save for the
new release in the fall. If demand holds steady with previous years, despite
the higher prices, it could boost Apple’s stock and return it to the spotlight
as one of the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/markets/stocks-usa/market-movers-gainers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;market
movers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do analysts say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on consensus valuations, 59% of analysts currently
rate Apple stock a “Buy,” 33.9% say “Hold,” and only 6.8% recommend “Sell.” The
12-month average price target is $227.30. As for where the optimism comes from,
given all the headwinds mentioned above, part of the answer lies in Morgan
Stanley&apos;s survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the bank, Apple&apos;s next wave of AI-based
features appears to resonate more strongly with U.S. consumers than expected.
In addition, among current iPhone users with access to Apple Intelligence,
willingness to pay for the service has increased 11% since last fall, reaching
an average of $9.11 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

The domestic buyers were much less than the six month average. The international buyers were better than expected given some positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless it required a positive tail and the bid to cover it was still less than the average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a great auction but it is not the best of issues as evidenced by the kink in the yield curve. The 10 year yield is that 4.550% while the 30-year is below the 20 year yield at 5.0321%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The price of bitcoin has moved to a new record high today, rising to an intraday high of $109,732. The current price is at $109,515, up $2700 or 2.55%. The move to new highs surpassed the January 10 high of $109,356.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the corrective low on May 12th at $100,764, the price has risen 9%. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the April 7 swing low down at $74,483, the price is up 47.24%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price has been above its 100-hour moving average on the 4-hour chart since April 11 when the price was near $82,800. The price tested the moving average on May 6 and bounced (see blue line).  It sniffed the moving average again on Monday before rotating higher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately would take a move below the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, to increase the bearish bias. That MA comes in at $102,378 (and moving higher). &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;190&quot; data-end=&quot;530&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD has extended its decline, breaking below a series of key support levels and reinforcing the bearish momentum that has gripped the pair since last week. After failing twice last week at the 200-day moving average near 1.4016 (higher green line), sellers took control, and the break below the 100- and 200-hour MAs with momentum yesterday, confirmed the shift in near-term bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;532&quot; data-end=&quot;795&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier today, the pair tested, then broke below the 1.38607 support, triggering further downside and clearing the way for a test of the next swing level at 1.38252. That level has now also given way, and the market is eyeing the extreme lows from 2025, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;797&quot; data-end=&quot;941&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;797&quot; data-end=&quot;822&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;799&quot; data-end=&quot;822&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.37810 (swing low from April 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;823&quot; data-end=&quot;859&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;825&quot; data-end=&quot;859&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.37698 (swing low from April 30)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;860&quot; data-end=&quot;884&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;884&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3759 (swing low from May 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;941&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;887&quot; data-end=&quot;941&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.37497 (low for year from May 6, 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;885&quot; data-end=&quot;941&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;887&quot; data-end=&quot;941&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3441 (61.8% retracement of the 2023–2024 rally - not shown)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;📉 Bias:
Bearish below 1.3860.
Breaks of 1.3825 and 1.3781 increase downside momentum toward the 2025 low extreme zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;943&quot; data-end=&quot;1128&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These levels mark critical downside targets for sellers aiming to extend the move further. Momentum favors a push toward that lower band unless buyers can reclaim broken support levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1327&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the upside, 1.3860 now becomes initial resistance, with a broader bearish risk zone up to 1.3891–1.3904. A move back above this range is needed to signal any meaningful shift in control.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major European indices are closing the day mixed/little changed, erasing earlier declines at the start of the US session. The snapshot of the closing levels shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +0.34%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.36%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, +0.06%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, -0.11%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +0.07%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German DAX closed at a new record level. The DAX&apos;s ascent to record levels is attributed to a combination of strong corporate earnings, positive economic indicators, and investor confidence in Germany&apos;s economic resilience. Sectors such as technology, telecommunications, finance, pharmaceuticals, and energy have been at the forefront of this growth, reflecting a diversified and robust market performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK FTSE 100 closed at 8786.47, which is within shouting distance of its record high close from February 28 at 8809.75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex closed at a new high, going back to 2008&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;House Speaker Johnson and House Freedom Caucus Harris will go meet US Pres. Trump this afternoon at 3 PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris earlier today said that they are encouraged by the progress in the last 24 hours, but does not think it can be done today or even this week. He said he is confident he could be done in 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP Hoy commented that there is a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Sherman from PunchBowl is saying that Trump is expected to tell the House Finance Committee, that the bill needs to pass today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech slowdown persists: Consumer cyclical and healthcare sectors seize opportunity</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market experienced a nuanced day with mixed performances across various sectors. While the technology sector seems to be losing its previous momentum, evidenced by Microsoft (MSFT) declining by 0.44% and Oracle (ORCL) dropping by 0.62%, there is burgeoning resilience in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer cyclical sectors, notably Amazon (AMZN), saw a significant dip of 1.05%. This underperformance highlights consumer caution amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, healthcare stocks like Eli Lilly (LLY) experienced a 1.40% fall, indicating potential reevaluations within drug manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, some areas demonstrated robust growth, with communication services shining as Google (GOOG) surged by 3.53% and Meta (META) rising by 0.71%, reflecting investor confidence in these internet giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market sentiment today reveals a cautious yet optimistic tone. Investors appear increasingly wary of the technology sector&apos;s prospects, likely due to valuation concerns or broader economic signals. The confidence in communication services reflects a strategic pivot towards sectors perceived as more stable or with promising potentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the stability within certain industrial segments suggests that investors are factoring in expected infrastructural developments and potential fiscal policies supporting long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given today&apos;s trends, investors might consider reducing exposure to underperforming tech stocks while exploring opportunities within the communication services sphere. The tech sector&apos;s momentary deceleration necessitates a cautious yet opportunistic approach—watch for signals of recovery or further downturns before making adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resilience within the communication services and some industrial stocks indicates promising growth areas. Strategic diversification, especially into sectors like utilities and basic materials which have shown stability, could hedge against sector-specific volatilities. Investors should remain alert to macroeconomic developments and policy changes that might influence these dynamics, ensuring their portfolios are well-positioned to navigate these transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest updates and detailed analyses, stay connected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; where comprehensive market coverage keeps you informed of every crucial movement.📈&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;187&quot; data-end=&quot;482&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD surged to its highest level since 2022 earlier today, driven by stronger-than-expected UK CPI data that reinforced hawkish rate expectations. The rally took the pair above both the 2024 high at 1.3433 (not shown) and the 2025 high at 1.34419, with the advance stalling at 1.34695.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;484&quot; data-end=&quot;779&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After peaking, the pair pulled back and moved back below those multi-year highs. Buyers turned to sellers, and turned the price back toward a swing area between 1.33619 and 1.33784, but found buyers ahead of the lower boundary, bottoming at 1.3388. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;484&quot; data-end=&quot;779&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price has rebounded in the early US session, and brought price action back into the resistance zone between 1.3423 and 1.3441 - the old highs from 2024/2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;781&quot; data-end=&quot;1170&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A second break above this resistance area would signal renewed bullish momentum, especially if the pair can pierce and hold above the intraday high at 1.34695. Conversely, failure to extend above 1.3441 or a sharp rejection from current levels could spark further downside pressure, with traders eyeing a return to the 1.3378–1.3362 area as the next potential support zone, followed by the rising 100 hour MA and the 38.2% retracement both currently at 1.33438. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1177&quot; data-end=&quot;1202&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1204&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1204&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1206&quot; data-end=&quot;1221&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1224&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1224&quot; data-end=&quot;1251&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1226&quot; data-end=&quot;1251&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.34419 – April 2025 high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1254&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1256&quot; data-end=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.34695 – Today’s high / highest since 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1302&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1359&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3500 – Psychological round number (watch on breakout)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1361&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1363&quot; data-end=&quot;1375&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1378&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1378&quot; data-end=&quot;1429&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1380&quot; data-end=&quot;1429&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.3423 – Lower end of swing high area &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1432&quot; data-end=&quot;1467&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1434&quot; data-end=&quot;1467&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.33619 to 1.33784 – Swing area&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1508&quot; data-end=&quot;1568&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1472&quot; data-end=&quot;1505&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;1.33438 – 100 hour MA and the 38.2% of the May trading range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1575&quot; data-end=&quot;1667&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bullish above 1.3441; bearish tilt if price fails at highs and slips below 1.3362.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;488&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD has experienced a choppy four-day stretch, marked by key technical tests on both ends of the range. After dipping to a low of 0.6391 yesterday—just above the prior support zone near 0.6388 (Thursday/Friday’s lows)—buyers stepped in and defended the level, forming a near-term base. That bounce highlights the 0.6388–0.6391 area as key support, where recent dip-buyers found value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;490&quot; data-end=&quot;706&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rebound has since taken the pair back above the 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages, both converging near 0.6425, which now represent close support and a barometer for short-term bull/bear bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;708&quot; data-end=&quot;955&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, price has stalled just ahead of the 200-day moving average, currently near 0.6454, which is acting as resistance. A break above that level would open the door for more upside momentum, but for now, buyers face a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;957&quot; data-end=&quot;1055&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In summary, the last four sessions show a market respecting well-defined technical boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1058&quot; data-end=&quot;1108&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support held at multi-day lows (0.6388–0.6391)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1109&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1111&quot; data-end=&quot;1160&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance formed near the 200-day MA (~0.6454)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1161&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1163&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The battle line is now drawn at the 100/200-hour MAs (~0.6425)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1231&quot; data-end=&quot;1246&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1247&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1249&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.6425 (100/200-hour MAs), 0.6388–0.6391&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1303&quot; data-end=&quot;1348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1305&quot; data-end=&quot;1348&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6454 (200-day MA), 0.6469&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1349&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1351&quot; data-end=&quot;1420&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral-to-bullish above 0.6425, bearish tilt resumes below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally , yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate to 3.85% from 4.10%, as widely expected, citing easing inflation and a more balanced risk outlook. While headline inflation may temporarily rise, underlying inflation is projected to stay near the midpoint of the 2–3% target range. The RBA noted recovering domestic demand and persistent labor market tightness, but flagged growing uncertainty from global trade tensions and tariffs. Despite the rate cut, the Board remains cautious and emphasized that monetary policy will remain responsive to evolving economic risks both at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut did help to send the pair lower yesterday to the support target, but rallied into the close. Today, the declines from yesterday have been retraced. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shares of Target fall 7% as the company highlights consumer weakness</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;What is happening with the US consumer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the market breathed a sigh of relief after Walmart maintained its annual sales forecast. The CFO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/hard-to-find-any-sign-of-weakness-in-the-us-consumer-20250515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;February was softer than expected, March was back to normal and April was very strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could the signal have been that higher-end consumers who usually shop at Target trading down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TGT is down 7% after missing Q1 revenue estimates. The company also cut its full-year sales outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of that may be because of the DEI dance the company is doing but I find it hard to believe that consumers actually care. The company blamed most of the decline on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales were down nearly 3% compared to a year ago. The company now expects a low-single digit decline in sales this 
fiscal year, compared to a previous forecast of net sales growth of 
about 1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Brian Cornell  said that “ongoing pressure in our discretionary business, plus five consecutive 
months of declining consumer confidence, tariff uncertainty and the 
reaction to the updates we shared on belonging in January.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also remember that consumers haven&apos;t even been hit by tariff price hikes yet. The company said that price hikes are a &quot;last resort&quot; but didn&apos;t rule them out.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD remains under pressure, continuing its slide that began last week after the pair tested and failed at the 200-day moving average on two occasions (higher green line currently at 1.4016). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;396&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The price traded above and below the 100 and 200 hour MAs over the last two trading days, with the 100 hour MA stalling the last rally yesterday before rotating lower.  When the price fell below the lows from Monday and Tuesday near 1.3917 in the Asian session today, the sellers pushed lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;398&quot; data-end=&quot;728&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Price is now trading to new lows and is testing a key swing level near 1.38607. A break below this level would put the price in the lower extreme area for 2025 which bottomed at 1.37497.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;398&quot; data-end=&quot;728&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance now comes in between 1.3891 and 1.3904, which must be cleared to ease the bearish bias and shift near-term control back toward buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;730&quot; data-end=&quot;846&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking at the daily chart below, the low price for 2025 stalled just ahead of the 61.8% of the move up from the 2023 low at 1.37415 (the low reached 1.37497 within 8 pips of that target).  Swing levels toward that low would eye 1.3646 and below that the low from April at 1.3780.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;730&quot; data-end=&quot;846&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sellers are in control.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;848&quot; data-end=&quot;863&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;921&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;921&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38607, 1.3825, 1.3749 (2025 low extreme), 1.37415 (61.8% off daily)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;922&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;924&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3891–1.3904, 1.3917 (swing level) 1.3949 (100-hour MA), 1.4016 (200-day MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;999&quot; data-end=&quot;1073&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 1.3904, downside risks increase on break of 1.3860&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Analyzing forex market
trends is critical for traders aiming to capitalize on currency movements.
Accurate data analysis and the use of advanced trading tools empower traders to
make informed decisions. Understanding key data sources and trading signals enhances
trend analysis, providing a competitive edge in the forex market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic world of
forex trading, staying ahead of market trends can significantly impact your
success. Market trends in forex are patterns or directions that currency values
tend to follow over a period. By understanding these trends, you can better
anticipate future movements and make strategic trading decisions. Utilizing
effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economies.com/best-brokers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;best trading software&lt;/a&gt; can further enhance
your ability to analyze these trends effectively. This article explores the
essential components of forex market trend analysis and the role of advanced
tools in optimizing trading strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding forex market trends &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forex market trends
refer to the general direction in which a currency pair&apos;s value is moving.
Recognizing these trends is vital for traders as it informs their buying and
selling strategies. Trends can be bullish, bearish, or sideways, each offering
unique opportunities and challenges. Bullish trends indicate rising prices,
while bearish trends suggest falling prices. Sideways trends show a lack of
strong directional movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders often rely on
technical analysis to identify these trends, using chart patterns and
indicators to predict future price actions. Understanding the nature of forex
trends allows traders to align their strategies with prevailing market
conditions. By analyzing historical price data, traders can determine potential
entry and exit points that maximize profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful trend
analysis involves more than just recognizing patterns; it requires interpreting
these patterns within the context of broader economic events. Economic
indicators, geopolitical developments, and monetary policies all influence
currency movements. Being aware of these factors helps you understand why a
trend is occurring, enabling you to anticipate changes and adjust your
strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key data sources for trend analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate trend analysis
in the forex market relies heavily on robust data sources. Traders frequently
turn to economic calendars to track upcoming events that could impact currency
valuations. These calendars provide information on interest rate announcements,
employment reports, and other economic indicators that influence forex markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical data
source is historical price charts, which offer insights into past market
behaviors. By studying these charts, traders can identify recurring patterns
and use them to forecast future movements. Technical indicators such as moving
averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence
Divergence) are invaluable tools for analyzing price data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, real-time
news feeds provide up-to-the-minute information on political events and
economic developments worldwide. Staying informed about global events helps
traders understand market sentiment and potential impacts on currency values.
Combining these data sources creates a comprehensive picture of market
conditions, enabling more precise trend predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing trading signals for decision-making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading signals play a
crucial role in interpreting forex market trends and guiding trading decisions.
These signals are generated by analyzing technical indicators and identifying
potential buy or sell opportunities based on specific criteria. They help you
pinpoint optimal times to enter or exit trades, maximizing profit potential
while minimizing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different
types of trading signals, including manual signals provided by experienced
analysts and automated signals generated by algorithms. Manual signals rely on
human expertise to interpret market data and suggest actions. In contrast,
automated signals use pre-set criteria within trading software to generate
alerts when conditions align with predefined parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of
trading signals depends on their accuracy and timeliness. To ensure reliable
outcomes, it&apos;s essential to evaluate the credibility of signal providers or the
algorithms used in generating them. Reliable signals enhance your decision-making
process by providing clear guidance amid volatile market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of advanced trading tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economies.com/best-brokers/forex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; best
forex trading platform&lt;/a&gt; will offer a wide range of tools for
traders. Advanced trading tools have revolutionized how traders analyze forex
market trends. These sophisticated platforms offer features such as real-time
analytics, customizable charts, and automated strategies that streamline the
trading process. They enable you to quickly assess large volumes of data and
make informed decisions with greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One significant
advantage of advanced trading tools is their ability to integrate various data
sources seamlessly. By consolidating information from different channels into a
single interface, they provide a holistic view of the market landscape. This integration
simplifies trend analysis by presenting comprehensive insights at your
fingertips.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of automation
within these tools also enhances efficiency by executing trades based on
predetermined criteria without manual intervention. This capability allows you
to capitalize on opportunities instantly while reducing emotional bias in
decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;93&quot; data-end=&quot;345&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF has rotated lower today, continuing the decline over the last 6 or so trading days..  The price has returned to a familiar swing area between 0.8193 and 0.8212, which has previously acted as the low of an up-and-down trading range (see Red Box). The pair found buyers on the initial test, with price bouncing modestly toward another swing area between 0.8272 and 0.82803.  This area is now close resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;347&quot; data-end=&quot;607&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A break above this zone would shift focus toward the falling 100-hour moving average at 0.83316, followed by the 200-hour MA at 0.83591, both of which represent key upside hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;609&quot; data-end=&quot;844&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Until then, the bearish bias remains in place with the descending trendline and moving averages acting as a ceiling. A break back below the lower end of the swing area at 0.8193 would open the door for further downside probing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;846&quot; data-end=&quot;861&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; data-is-last-node=&quot;&quot; data-is-only-node=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;891&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;864&quot; data-end=&quot;891&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8212, 0.8193&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;892&quot; data-end=&quot;969&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;894&quot; data-end=&quot;969&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8272–0.8280, 0.8332 (100-hour MA), 0.8359 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;970&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;972&quot; data-end=&quot;1034&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.8280, bullish potential above 0.8332&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Will the buyers defend 5% yields once again? The red flags are flying</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things going on in the economy, trade and politics at the moment that are worth watching closely but I believe the confluence of them all -- and the single most important metric to watch -- is the yield on long bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we&apos;ve seen three tests of 5% and they were all met by buyers, including early this week after the debt downgrade. But this time the buying momentum faded quickly and yields are up 5.5 bps to 5.02%. If we can close above 5% (especially on the weekly), that&apos;s a good sign that the buyers are exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, we could very quickly be talking about the 2023 high of 5.17%. That came at a time when Liz Truss was blowing up the UK economy and US inflation was out of control. It was also in a much stronger (at least nominally) economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this is a worrisome signal that&apos;s a problem for risk assets and it&apos;s a red flag that the US dollar is down today even as yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that 10-year yields are still within the 2025 range and have some decent breathing room ahead of the January high of 4.81%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECB&apos;s Centeno: We made need rates below neutral rate to prevent inflation sub-2%</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest rate to prevent inflation from falling under 2% may have to come below the neutral rate between 1.50-2.00%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing 1.64% as the low for ECB rates which is a bit more than 50 bps fully priced in. Getting helow his neutral range would mean at least one more cut on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
