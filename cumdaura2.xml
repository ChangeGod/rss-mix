                            &lt;p&gt;Tech sector rebounds: Nvidia and Google lead market gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US stock market is seeing a notable uptick today, with significant contributions from the technology sector. As investors navigate an increasingly nuanced landscape, both Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG) have emerged as standout performers, driving the day&apos;s positive momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology: The tech sector is buoying the market, highlighting a day of robust performance. Nvidia (NVDA) is up 2.02%, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Google (GOOG) adds 2.12% to its value, suggesting strong market sentiment in internet content and information services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical: Despite tech gains, the consumer cyclical sector shows mixed results. Tesla (TSLA) is bucking this trend with a 1.71% increase, driven by positive developments in the auto industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Defensive:Walmart (WMT) is up 1.27%, indicating some defensive play as investors hedge around economic uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: The sector is under pressure with AbbVie (ABBV) down 2.28% amid broader industry challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financial: Steady yet unspectacular, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gaining 0.63%, offering a small beacon of stability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s market is characterized by optimism largely rooted in tech sector performance. Investor sentiment appears bullish on tech rebounds, particularly semiconductors and internet services. However, mixed signals from consumer sectors suggest caution as market participants await further economic data that could sway trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should keep a close watch on technological advancements and data-driven trends in the tech sector. There&apos;s a clear opportunity to capitalize on the renewed strength seen in companies like Nvidia and Google. Meanwhile, it&apos;s prudent to maintain a balanced portfolio, given the mixed performance across other sectors such as healthcare and consumer cyclicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the tech-led recovery, consider shifting focus towards robust performers within the sector while maintaining diversification to safeguard against potential volatility.

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;84&quot; data-end=&quot;428&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;GBPUSD&apos;s earlier rally stalled at the familiar resistance zone between 1.33619 and 1.33784, where sellers leaned in and capped upside momentum. The pullback found support earlier today at the 200-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, and the pair is now retracing lower toward that level again, presenting a potential dip-buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;430&quot; data-end=&quot;785&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For buyers, holding above this key moving average and reclaiming ground toward 1.33227 and beyond would signal renewed bullish intent. On the flip side, if sellers manage to push the pair below the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 1.32859 and then the 100-hour MA near the 1.32577 swing area, bearish pressure would likely build, shifting the bias lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;430&quot; data-end=&quot;785&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key support test for the GBPUSD.  Can the buyers stall the fall? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;787&quot; data-end=&quot;812&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;813&quot; data-end=&quot;1049&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;813&quot; data-end=&quot;868&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;815&quot; data-end=&quot;868&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.33619‚Äì1.33784 (swing area), 1.3423 to 1.34413 (swing highs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;869&quot; data-end=&quot;976&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;871&quot; data-end=&quot;976&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.32859 (100-bar MA on 4H), 1.32577 (100-hour MA and swing area),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;977&quot; data-end=&quot;1049&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;979&quot; data-end=&quot;1049&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral-to-bullish above 1.32859; bearish bias below 1.32577&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1051&quot; data-end=&quot;1232&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum will hinge on how price reacts around the moving average cluster. A bounce would reinforce bullish positioning, while a break below could open the door to further downside.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;89&quot; data-end=&quot;394&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After initially breaking above the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.5946, NZDUSD gained upside traction, pushing to a high of 0.5968. However, the bullish momentum quickly faded, and the pair has since slipped back below both the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.59464, and, more recently, the 200-hour MA at 0.59378. The pair is now trading near 0.5930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With upside momentum stalled, the technical bias has shifted back in favor of sellers below the aforementioned moving average levels. The next downside target lies at the 100-hour MA at 0.59063. A break below that level would strengthen the bearish outlook and open the door toward another key MA - the 200-day MA at 0.5883. That will be a critical zone that could either act as a floor or lead to further downside extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, the NZDUSD moved down to test the rising 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart and found buyers (on Monday and Tuesday&apos;s lows).  If the selling momentum increases, that MA will be in the back of traders minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;743&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the momentum lower fades, getting back above the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart at 0.59464 would disappoint sellers and give the buyers more hope and control.  There is a ceiling between 0.6018 to 0.60281.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;745&quot; data-end=&quot;770&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;771&quot; data-end=&quot;979&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;771&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;773&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immediate resistance: 0.5946 (broken 100-bar MA on 4H), 0.5968 (recent high from earlier today)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;854&quot; data-end=&quot;918&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;918&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support levels: 0.59063 (100-hour MA), 0.5883 (200-day MA), 0.58579 (the rising 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart. The lows for the week bottomed near that MA on Monday and Tuesday before racing higher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;919&quot; data-end=&quot;979&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;921&quot; data-end=&quot;979&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.5946 in the short term. , intensifying below 0.59063&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;981&quot; data-end=&quot;1119&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traders should watch whether the 100-BA MA on the 4-hour holds restance. A bounce could attract dip buyers, but failure to hold it likely deepens the pullback.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;78&quot; data-end=&quot;368&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD rally ran into resistance near the 2025 extreme area around 0.65135 earlier today and quickly reversed lower, signaling fading bullish momentum. The pullback has now brought the pair down to test a key confluence of moving average support, most notably the 200-day MA at 0.64578.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;370&quot; data-end=&quot;804&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This level is critical. A successful defense here would provide buyers with a potential springboard to reattempt upside moves. However, failure to hold this support increases downside risk. Below the 200-day MA - but with work to do.  The 200-hour MA at 0.6440 and the dual support of the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart, and 100-hour MA are near the same level at 0.6418. A break below these levels would likely shift the bias back in favor of sellers and accelerate downside pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;806&quot; data-end=&quot;831&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;1082&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;832&quot; data-end=&quot;878&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;834&quot; data-end=&quot;878&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immediate support: 200-day MA at 0.64578&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;881&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Secondary support: 200-hour MA at 0.6440; 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart/100-hour MA at 0.6418&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;957&quot; data-end=&quot;1007&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;959&quot; data-end=&quot;1007&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.65135 (2025 extreme high area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1008&quot; data-end=&quot;1082&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1010&quot; data-end=&quot;1082&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral near term; bullish above 0.64578, bearish below 0.6418&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1084&quot; data-end=&quot;1271&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buyers have a chance to hold the line, but if momentum continues to falter, bears may regain control. Traders should watch closely for confirmation on either side of this support cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 0.3% in the early going while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t much (anything?) on the calendar to derail things today so we&apos;ll wait for the usual Trump tweets and other news out of the White House. That said, what could really change things? Tariff policy is paused on various timelines and Republicans are grinding away on the tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is in a holding pattern for at least a month and there is no economic data to come today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That all works very well for the momentum trade.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;80&quot; data-end=&quot;361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCAD remains capped by key technical barriers, with Monday and Tuesday&apos;s rally stalling near the 200-day moving average at 1.40114 and the critical swing zone between 1.40097 and 1.40268. This area has proven to be a firm ceiling for now, with sellers defending their ground. The price of the USDCAD fell yesterday and again today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;363&quot; data-end=&quot;618&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite this resistance near the 200 day MA, the buyers have not given up. A bounce today - after the 2 day decline - started from the swing support area between 1.38917 and 1.3904. That suggests underlying demand remains intact. The buyers are still in play - at lease in the short term.  This zone was a ceiling until broken last week and basing.   That old ceiling/now floor is helping to define the current consolidation range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;620&quot; data-end=&quot;860&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For buyers to reassert control, they will need to push decisively through nearby resistance at 1.3967 (200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart) to 1.3977 (high from April 15) . A break above that zone would open the path toward the more formidable confluence of the 200-day MA and the high of a swing area at 1.40268.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;862&quot; data-end=&quot;887&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;888&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;888&quot; data-end=&quot;930&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;890&quot; data-end=&quot;930&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.38917‚Äì1.3904 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;931&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;933&quot; data-end=&quot;972&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immediate resistance: 1.3967‚Äì1.3977&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;973&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;975&quot; data-end=&quot;1051&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Major resistance: 1.40097‚Äì1.40268 (swing zone) and 200-day MA at 1.40114&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Cautiously bullish above 1.3904; more bullish confirmation on break of 1.40268&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1144&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum above 1.3977 could reignite upside pressure, but failure to clear resistance risks renewed downside probing.&lt;/p&gt;

JPMorgan Chase has been steadily developing its own blockchain tech for years.

This level has provided a floor over the past few weeks and remains a critical line in the sand for near-term bullish hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;378&quot; data-end=&quot;663&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the recent bounce, upside momentum stalled earlier in the week just ahead of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the March‚ÄìApril decline, which comes in at 0.84823. Sellers leaned into that level, capping further advances for now and keeping the broader bearish pressure intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;665&quot; data-end=&quot;953&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;To shift the bias more definitively to the upside, bulls will need to push the pair above the 0.8333‚Äì0.8373 zone, which represents a key swing area from the daily chart. A firm break above this region would be considered a bullish development and could open the door for further recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;955&quot; data-end=&quot;991&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Summary of key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;992&quot; data-end=&quot;1062&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;994&quot; data-end=&quot;1062&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.83184‚Äì0.8333 zone (prior ceiling now acting as floor)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1063&quot; data-end=&quot;1151&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1065&quot; data-end=&quot;1151&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8373 (upper end of swing zone off daily chart), then 0.84823 (38.2% Fib retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1152&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1229&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bias: Neutral to cautiously bullish above 0.8333 (in the short term); bearish below 0.83184&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1231&quot; data-end=&quot;1395&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A sustained move outside of the current range will likely define the next directional bias.

                            &lt;p&gt;Gold is running stops after breaking the May 1 low. It&apos;s now down $60 to $3187 after the May bottom of $3202 was breached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold had tried to form a double bottom at $3200 but that effort has failed now in light of the climb-down in the trade war and ceasefire in India/Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early-April high should offer some modest support at $3167 with some at $3150 as well.  Beyond that we&apos;re looking at $3100 and the big figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many assets have retraced the &apos;Liberation Day&apos; moves and that would get back to around $3120 but technically, the post-Liberation &apos;sell everything&apos; low near $3000 looks like it&apos;s in play.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;When navigating online trading
recommendations, it&apos;s easy to come across information that goes against the
grain of conventional financial wisdom. Some of these bits of advice are
questionable, while others can be straight-up harmful to your financial outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Octa, a regulated and trusted broker, breaks
down some of the worst advice traders can follow and describes potential
consequences that can ensue while offering viable counterarguments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmful
advice #1: forget about brokers&apos; reputation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a trader who doesn&apos;t care whether
their broker is regulated and trusted, focusing solely on short-term financial
gains mentioned in ads. This approach can be rooted in the unwillingness to go
into too much detail when choosing a broker. After all, the difference between
regulated and unregulated brokers often becomes evident only with time. It&apos;s
not always possible to spot a difference from the get-go, especially for the
less experienced traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, regulation plays a crucial role in
defining brokers&apos; reliability. Some unregulated brokers may engage in unethical
or illegal practices, such as unauthorised trading, churning (excessive trading
to generate commissions), or offering fake investment products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, a more reasonable approach
would be to choose an experienced and globally regulated broker whose
trustworthiness has been proven by traders&apos; reviews. If a broker meets the
strict criteria of multiple regulatory bodies from various regions, it is much
more likely to be a safer choice for traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmful
advice #2: withdrawals are always easy, don&apos;t fret about it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s only natural for those starting their
trading journey to look only one step ahead and focus on achieving financial
gains first. After all, tapping into a viable source of supplementary income is
one of the main reasons why people start trading in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem that once traders have reached
their financial goals, cashing in their profits should not be a problem.
However, this is where things can easily go wrong unless you have carefully
chosen your broker based on public information about its withdrawals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By establishing a transparent, user-friendly
transactional mechanism and offering a wide variety of withdrawal options,
brokers show a client-oriented approach to business and send a clear message to
their clients about their reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep abreast with the industry benchmarks,
Octa, a globally recognised broker with more than 14 years of experience,
offers a fast and efficient withdrawal procedure confirmed by real-life
traders&apos; reviews. All Octa&apos;s fees and conditions are fully disclosed in the
broker&apos;s terms and conditions, creating a reliable trading environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmful
advice #3: don&apos;t pay attention to trading conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, trading conditions offered by
a broker may seem a minor detail that is not worthy of consideration. After
all, if your strategy is viable and you execute it perfectly time and time
again, what can go wrong? But it is worth remembering that in trading, gains
and losses are marginal most of the time, and long-term success highly depends
on the broker&apos;s fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing a financial broker, the more you
know, the better. This is especially applicable to trading conditions. Choosing
a broker with advantageous conditions, including low spreads, efficient
withdrawals, and transparent fees, may not yield immediate gains, but will have
a considerable long-term impact on your outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When starting trading with a broker, always
make sure to test their advertised trading conditions before fully committing
with your deposits. Only brokers that are fully transparent about their charges
are worth your trust. For example, Octa broker&apos;s long and successful track
record and lack of hidden fees can be verified through thousands of positive
online reviews. However, for any trader, the best way is always to test trading
conditions firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmful
advice #4: in trading, caution is for the weak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a new trader, it may seem that risk
management tools are only applicable if you deal with extra-fast time frames or
place many orders simultaneously. Otherwise, there is no point in wasting your
time on insignificant details since a couple of high-risk trades will likely
determine your success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it couldn&apos;t be further from the
truth. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are a must for any trader, regardless
of their style and asset preferences. When traders focus on short-term profits
and disregard the strategic aspect of trading, including using risk management
tools, they enter the realm of random outcomes, which doesn&apos;t operate in their
favour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring risk management tools and fully
trusting your emotions during the stressful moments of high market volatility
is almost like trying to extinguish fire with gasoline. Trading becomes much
less stressful and more efficient if you approach it with a cool head and use
all the tools at your disposal to navigate sudden bursts of volatility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trading, following the fundamental rules
from step one is essential for long-term success. These rules include choosing
a reliable broker, since this is the only way to ensure a smooth trading
experience overall. By ensuring fast withdrawals and a transparent, clearly
communicated fee structure, brokers enable their clients to achieve their
financial goals‚Äîand thus build up their reputation for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance reminder: trading Contracts for
Difference (CFDs) carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all
investors. Emotional trading can increase this risk. Always trade within your
means and understand the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Octa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.octafx.com?utm_source=media&amp;amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TrustWWS9&amp;amp;utm_content=ww_fx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Octa &lt;/a&gt;is an international broker that has

                            &lt;p&gt;The dollar decline has continued today with the greenback falling by -1% vs the JPY. The declines vs the EUR (-0.35%) and the GBP (-0.24%) have been less (and the EURUSD and GBPUSD are off their extremes for the day). Nevertheless, after the gains on Monday after the US/China deal, the greenback has retraced those gains and more.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the EURUSD and the USDJPY, the price moves have taken the price back between the 100/200 hour MAs or into a more neutral territory. For the GBPUSD, the pair has moved back above those two key MAs putting the buyers more in control from a technical perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video above, I take a technical look at those three major currency pairs to kickstart the US trading day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overnight in central bank commentary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB policymaker Joachim Nagel expressed optimism that the eurozone is on track to reach its 2% inflation target, though he emphasized that uncertainty is likely to remain a persistent feature of the economic landscape. He noted that central banks must adapt to this new &quot;normal&quot; of ongoing unpredictability. Nagel highlighted the importance of upcoming staff projections in June, while acknowledging the unknown impact that tariffs could have on inflation and broader economic conditions. The ECB&apos;s June rate decision will depend heavily on incoming data. Separately, Nagel also commented on the global financial system, stating that while the U.S. dollar remains dominant, the euro is expected to gain strength as a reserve currency in the coming years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed&apos;s Goolsbee, a 2025 voter, indicated that part of the April inflation data reflects the lagged nature of how inflation trends appear in economic reports. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve is still in a wait-and-see mode, holding off on major decisions until more information becomes available. Goolsbee noted that it will take time for current inflation dynamics to be accurately reflected, cautioning against drawing conclusions from short-term volatility. He stressed the importance of looking past the noise in the data before forming any long-term policy judgments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feds Daly (SF Fed Pres - nonvoting member) and Jefferson (FOMC Governor) are both scheduled to speak later today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are higher after gains in the broader S&amp;amp;P and Nasdaq yesterday (the Dow fell due to UnitedHealth&apos;s tumble) with the futures currently implying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial average futures implying a gain of 21.57 points. Yesterday the index fell -269.87 points or -0.64%. UnitedHealth contributed to a decline of -400 points itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index futures are implying a gain of 12.45 points. Yesterday, the index rose 42.36 points or 0.72%. The S&amp;amp;P index closed positive on the year by 0.08% yesterday..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq futures are implying a gain of  76.30 points. Yesterday the index gained 301.74 points or 1.61%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European markets, the major indices are mixed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German Dax, -0.30%. Yesterday the index closed at a record level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC, -0.38%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK FTSE 100, +0.04%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex, +0.34%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB, +0.39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, yields are higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 4.013%, -0.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.108%, -1.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.480%, -1.8 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 4.921%, -2.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other markets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil down $0.70 on -1.10% at $62.97&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver unchanged at $32.88&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is down $29 or -0.91% at $3219.50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up little changed at $104,063&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic calendar is light with the Canada building permits scheduled for 830. The expectations are -0.5% versus +2.9% last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10:30 AM ET, the weekly inventory data will be release with crude oil inventories expected to show a drop of -1.078 million. Gasoline is expected to fall by -0.561 million while distillates are expected to show a build of 0.129 million..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private data released late yesterday showed a surprise build of 4.287 million in crude inventories. Gasoline inventories fell -1.374 million and distillates fell -3.675 million&lt;/p&gt;

We are now consolidating at a key resistance zone, but a breakout and new highs look more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

He offered up some comments about the Middle East and also on the potential meeting with Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. Besides that, there weren&apos;t much interesting remarks from the man today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In terms of data, German and Spanish inflation numbers reaffirmed that there is still work to be done by the ECB even if rate cuts are still set to continue. And we got some token remarks from central bank speakers from the Fed, ECB, and BOE for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for market action, major currencies are seeing decent moves with the dollar in particular standing out. The greenback is continuing to stutter and has surrendered pretty much all of its gains from the opening gap higher on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;EUR/USD moved up to a high of 1.1265 during the session but is now still up 0.3% at 1.1220 on the day. Meanwhile, USD/JPY also fell to a low of 145.60 before picking up a little to 146.16 now - down 0.9% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Elsewhere, GBP/USD is up 0.2% to 1.3335 while AUD/USD is marginally higher by 0.1% to 0.6472. The latter is seeing large option expiries at 0.6475 and 0.6500 in play, with the ones at the figure level limiting gains on the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, European stocks are looking rather timid today with little conviction. US futures were down initially but have picked up a little to be up 0.2% now. The dip buying could be suggestive of a continuation of gains later when Wall Street enters the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the commodities space, gold is down alongside oil. So, that is offering up a bit more of a mixed picture in broader markets. Treasury yields are also sitting lower but are still hanging on the high side with 30-year yields hovering close by the 5% mark. So, that&apos;s still something to watch out for in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m not sure the EU has the spine to fight a protracted trade war with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECB supervisors step up checks on dollar funding at banks over Trump concerns - report</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/news/ecb-supervisors-step-up-checks-on-dollar-funding-at-banks-over-trump-concerns-report-20250514/</link>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is being reported that ECB supervisors have pressed banks in the region to assess their dollar funding needs especially if there is market distress. The idea here is that they are fearing a possible scenario in which they cannot tap into Fed facilities if Trump decides to pressure the Fed into blocking that. For some context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/european-officials-concerned-over-relying-on-fed-for-usd-funding-in-times-of-mkt-stress-20250322/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;it&apos;s not the first time&lt;/a&gt; this concern has been brought up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;During times of financial stress, the Fed typically provides lending facilities to major counterparts to alleviate shortages in the dollar. But amid the erratic policy rollout by Trump, officials are fearing that this funding source could be shut down abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;So far, two sources said that the Fed had never suggested that it would not stand by those backstops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Funnily enough, the recent market swings seem to be suggesting an aversion to the dollar though. And at least for the time being, the ECB can take in some comfort of better developments from the US-China trade conflict. We&apos;ve definitely bought some temporary reprieve on the trade front but who&apos;s to say what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crude oil is back at the key resistance zone as a breakout becomes likely</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The crude oil market has been battered by negative news on both the demand and supply side in April and that weighed a lot on prices. More recently, the demand side of the equation started to improve as positive developments on the trade front made the market to expect better global growth ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, we might have a doube bottom but we will need a break above the resistance to confirm that. Fundamentally, the uptrend should remain intact as long as things continue to improve. In my opinion, a rally to 72.00 looks very likely now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the price is back at the key resistance zone around the 64.00 level. This is where we can expect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the level to position for a drop back into the 55.00 level. The buyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish bets into the major trendline around the 67.00 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have an upward trendline defining the bullish momentum. If we get a pullback, we can expect the buyers to lean on the trendline with a defined risk below it to position for a break above the resistance. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to increase the bearish bets into the 55.00 level next. &lt;/p&gt;

And that will certainly continue to irk Trump, with his latest disdain towards Fed chair Powell coming yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/trump-tells-powell-to-cut-rates-let-it-all-happen-it-will-be-a-beautiful-thing-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
