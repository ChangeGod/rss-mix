                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling down $1.16 or -1.99% and $57.13. The low price today reached $55.39. That was just short of the low price from April 9 $55.15. It was the lowest close since February 10, 2021. The daily chart, the next major target below $55.15 is the 61.8% retracement of the move up from the 2020 low. That level comes in $49.44.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not too bad of a day for oil, given the circumstances</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;WTI crude oil settled lower by $1.16 to $57.13 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s another down day for crude but oil companies are probably feeling a sigh of relief given that OPEC+ raised production on the weekend and there was a report saying they would continue to add barrels until there was cooperation from Kazakhstan and Iraq on repaying excess barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April low of $55.12 held for now but I strongly suspect there will need to be some good news to get oil moving back higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, it will just take time for the oil market to rebalance. At $55, US oil producers rapidly slow down drilling and with natural decline rates at 20% per year, it doesn&apos;t take long for the barrels to fall off on the supply side.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I strongly suspect, the tone of the meeting and comments afterwards will be market moving for the loonie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think anyone is expecting any kind of deal or short-term changes in tariff rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also from Trump:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;China wants to make a deal very badly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices are remaining in negative territory although they are off their lowest levels and trading near their highest levels. Nevertheless the S&amp;amp;P index is in jeopardy of snapping it nine-day win streak. The NASDAQ index is the weakest today but only by -0.37%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since bottoming on April 21 at 4835.04, the S&amp;amp;P index reached a high on Friday at 5700.70 or 11.74% from the low. The current price is at 5669.1 or -17.67 points or -0.31%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price last week moved above its 50-day moving average currently at 5575.88. It would take a move below that moving average to disappoint the buyers. On the top side, the next target comes against its 200 day moving average at 5746.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the other major indices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average is up on the day by 40 points or 0.10% at 41357.35&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index is down -62 points are -0.35% at 17915.59.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European equity markets today, the major indices were mixed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +1.12%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Francis, -0.55%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100, +1.17%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spains Ibex, +0.53%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +0.39%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Reminder, on Thursday, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said &quot;I&apos;m sure there will be news by the end of the day&quot; on a tariff deal. We&apos;re still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bessent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trading deals maybe as early as this week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m highly confident that 17 trading partners excluding China have presented with very good trade proposals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could see more frictionless trade from these negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could see substantial progress with China in the coming weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market is not pricing in inflation, hard data is still resilient&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, this would all result in very low tariffs between the US and the world but you have to have a great deal of faith to make that call at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;253&quot; data-end=&quot;558&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GBPUSD buyers had their opportunity to reclaim control with a move above the  converged 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (at 1.33238), but momentum stalled, and the price has since rotated back lower. The failure to stay above those key MAs has shifted short-term control back to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;560&quot; data-end=&quot;761&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support continues to hold above a familiar swing area between 1.3259 and 1.3273, but that zone remains fragile. A confirmed break and hold below it would strengthen the bearish bias going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;763&quot; data-end=&quot;1010&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next downside targets come in at the April 23 low of 1.3232, followed by the swing area near 1.3203. A move through those levels would increase downside pressure and potentially open the door toward the 38.2% retracement at 1.3160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1012&quot; data-end=&quot;1152&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the buyers had their shot, it’s the sellers who are now dictating the pace—provided they can push and hold below the key support band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1154&quot; data-end=&quot;1169&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1170&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1172&quot; data-end=&quot;1222&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 1.3325 (200/100-hour MAs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1223&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1225&quot; data-end=&quot;1341&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3259–1.3273 (swing area), 1.3232 (April 23 low), 1.3203 (next swing area), 1.3160 (38.2% retracement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Reporter spoke with a White House spokesman who said that Trump&apos;s talk about tariffs may get walked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/white-house-clarifies-trump-movie-tariff-1236207216/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s initial tweet about it didn&apos;t leave much room for interpretation but the quick climbdown highlights that everything in this administration is made up as they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be the first tariff on a service, which is a dangerous game for the US to play because it has a huge trade surplus in services globally and virtually all of the major US tech companies are services exporters in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;189&quot; data-end=&quot;616&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD attempted to break above its 200-hour moving average at 1.13510 in early U.S. trading, but—just like on Friday—buyers lacked follow-through and momentum quickly faded. The failed breakout attracted fresh selling interest, and the price has since rotated lower, falling back below both the 200-hour and 100-hour moving averages (the latter at 1.13354), shifting short-term control back to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;618&quot; data-end=&quot;974&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next downside target lies at 1.13072, a low from the week before last. A break below that level would open the door toward the key swing area between 1.1271 and 1.12754. Beyond that, the 38.2% retracement of the March–April rally sits at 1.12505—a critical level for buyers to defend if they want to maintain control of the broader uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;976&quot; data-end=&quot;1227&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite buyers struggling to extend gains, sellers also have work to do. Only a firm move below 1.12505 level (the 38.2% retracement) would signal that they are regaining more meaningful control, challenging the buyers from the 843-pip rally from 1.0729 low on March 27 to 1.15726 high on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a distinct downturn in tech and energy sectors, leading to widespread volatility across the board. The technology sector, notably the consumer electronics and semiconductors segments, displays significant declines, with major players like Apple (AAPL) down by a steep 3.12% and Nvidia (NVDA) dipping 1.14%. Meanwhile, AMD bucks the trend, showing a positive gain of 1.97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the energy sector, leading companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are down 2.57% and 1.68%, respectively, contributing to the overall negative sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market&apos;s mood today is uncertain and bearish, with overarching dips in previously robust sectors. Investor trepidation stems from mixed economic signals and geopolitical tensions affecting resource availability and tech innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Cyclical: Amazon (AMZN) struggles, dropping 1.61%, impacted by mixed retail forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Services: Amidst the negativity, Google (GOOG) stays resilient with a 0.46% increase, reflecting sustained confidence in its innovative capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financials: This sector shows some resilience, with Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC) posting moderate gains of 0.53% and 0.52%, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: Stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Lilly (LLY) are slightly up, generally considered safe havens in volatile markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty looms large, urging investors to seek safety and reassess risk tolerance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversification remains key: With tech and energy in decline, investors might focus on more stable sectors such as financials and healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on innovation: Google&apos;s resilience suggests that companies with strong R&amp;D and innovative pipelines could be less susceptible to market swings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term opportunities: Use current dips as strategic entry points but prioritize sectors less affected by immediate global challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay updated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for real-time insights and expert analyses, and continue to watch the broader market trends closely in these volatile times. 📊&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;All last week there were reports that the US was close to a deal with India on tariffs and trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Bloomberg is reporting that India offered the USA rates of 0% of auto parts and steel so long as the US did the same. If the US takes that deal it would be very good news for everyone but it&apos;s hard to imagine they well. How is the US going to put 25% tariffs on Canadian steel but not on India? Or maybe everyone who makes a deal ends up with zero tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we will just have to wait for a deal and look at the details. Obviously, there are plenty of recent bets placed on a low-tariff world returning so we will see.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;252&quot; data-end=&quot;515&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The NZDUSD is trading with a bullish tilt after bouncing from its 100-hour moving average, which successfully stalled declines both on Friday and earlier today. That MA, currently near 0.5938, acted as a technical floor, helping buyers regain control. The price ultimately moved above its 200 hour moving average at 0.59515 and found more buyers and more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;769&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The upside momentum has pushed price back toward the familiar resistance zone around 0.6000, a key swing area that has capped the pair multiple times over the past two weeks (see red numbered circles). A break above this zone would open the door to more upside potential with the high from April the next obvious target at 0.60281.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;517&quot; data-end=&quot;769&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Move above that level and the price is trading at the highest level since November when the price high reached 0.6037. That level is also near the 61.8% retracement of the move down from the 2024 high to the 2025 low.  That little comes in a 0.60364&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;771&quot; data-end=&quot;994&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the bias remains tilted to the upside as long as price holds above the 200-hour MA. A move below it would weaken that bias and shift focus back toward the downside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;996&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1022&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1024&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6000 swing area (multi-day ceiling). 0.6028 (high for 2025). 0.6036 – 0.6037 (61.8% retracement and high from November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1156&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.5951 (200 hour moving average), 0.5939 (100-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

seasonal trends. We seem to be outperforming some of the publicly traded
 restaurants reporting results.” [Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Tariffs are negatively impacting small business customers. Many 
small business customers source their products from China. They cannot 
afford to compete in the marketplace sourcing from other countries. We 
could not move products fast enough to beat the tariff starting dates.” 
[Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp;amp; Hunting]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Business is steady.” [Construction]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“There is great concern at my institution (medical school with a 
research institute and hospital) that changes from the current 
administration will severely and adversely affect many of the 
populations we are trying to help live healthier lives.” [Educational 
Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We are actively reviewing the impact of tariffs. We are seeing some
 vendors increasing their prices, and we are actively pushing back on 
those increases. We expect our vendors to honor our contracted pricing.”
 [Health Care &amp;amp; Social Assistance]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Generally, pricing is lower, but there is some uncertainty of actual, final costs due to tariffs.” [Other Services]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our business is in a state of crises with uncertainty caused by 
both the ongoing trade war and the threats to federal funding of 
programs.” [Public Administration]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Uncertainty remains the dominating theme as the U.S. government has
 been maddeningly inconsistent with tariff implementation.” [Real 
Estate, Rental &amp;amp; Leasing]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Tariffs and concerns about government grants still impacting our 
procurement operations. Some projects are slowing or being held off to 
ensure we have funds to complete the current work.” [Transportation 
&amp;amp; Warehousing]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The tariff uncertainty is causing a lot of consumption of human 
capital. We are starting to see some tariff charges, some are 
significant given the price of the highly specialized units that were 
ordered over two years ago. Based on our spend over the last couple of 
years, we will have to adjust our capital and operations and maintenance
 plans.” [Utilities]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re seeing some bids in the US dollar in response to this report. USD/JPY is up to 143.90 from 143.66 while the euro has fallen 15 pips.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;136&quot; data-end=&quot;551&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is surging higher today and has convincingly broken above its 200-day moving average at 0.6461—a key technical milestone. On Friday, the pair briefly traded above this level for the first time since November 8, 2024, but bullish momentum faded, and the price settled back into a familiar swing area between 0.6427 and 0.6441. The Friday close landed near the upper end of that zone at 0.6441.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;553&quot; data-end=&quot;804&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In early Asian trading today, the low dipped to 0.64337, within that same swing zone, before buyers stepped back in. The price reclaimed the 200-day MA, briefly pulled back to retest it, then based and pushed to a fresh session high at 0.6493.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;806&quot; data-end=&quot;1074&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the pair now holding above the 200-day MA for a sustained period, 0.6461 becomes a key bias-defining support level. As long as the price remains above, the upside bias stays intact. Sellers gain no technical traction unless price breaks back below that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1076&quot; data-end=&quot;1244&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the daily chart, the next upside target lies at the November 29 swing high of 0.65277, followed by the 61.8% retracement and high from November 25 at 0.6549 (see the chart below).&lt;/p&gt;

in new work during April&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expansion in staffing was &apos;marginal&apos;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rate of inflation eased considerably from
March’s one-and-a-half year high to its weakest of 2025 so far&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, sentiment was at its lowest
level for two-and-a-half years and amongst the weakest since
the height of the pandemic in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;amp;P Global
Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;While tariff announcements mean manufacturing dominates
the news, a worrying backstory is developing in the vastly
larger services economy, where business activity and hiring
have come closer to stalling in April amid plunging business
confidence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Business and consumer facing service providers alike, and
especially financial services firms, are reporting markedly
weaker growth prospects, citing intensifying uncertainty over
the economic outlook amid recent tariff announcements and
ongoing federal spending cuts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;A key area of weakness is slumping exports of services, which
is now falling at rate not seen since 2022, but domestic demand
is also reportedly waning as confidence slides lower.
&quot;Higher prices paid for imports due to tariffs are also driving
up service sector firms’ costs, feeding though to higher prices,
notably in consumer-facing industries such as restaurants and
hotels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The resulting bottom line from the services sector is a
heightened risk of stalling growth and rising inflation, or
stagflation.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In March this index fell to 41.2 from 46.6, which was the lowest reading since June 2020. It bounced slightly here but that&apos;s hardly reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite index 41.7 vs 42.0 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Job losses were recorded for
a fourth successive month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lack of present incoming new work meant firms were
generally willing to let employees leave without replacing
them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firms chose on average to reduce
their selling prices for the first time in nearly four years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panellists reported that sales volumes had continued to
deteriorate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Backlogs of work were nonetheless reduced
markedly again as capacity remained more than sufficient to
deal with current workloads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sure sounds like a recession and that the BOC needs to get ahead of the curve. This report doesn&apos;t get a great deal of attention in the market but maybe it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Smith, Economics Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market
Intelligence, said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Canada’s service sector economy faced another
challenging month, with activity declining steeply and
new business volumes again down sharply. Firms again
linked these weak trends to widespread economic and
political uncertainty, in turn linked to trade policies
and, at the time of survey data collection, the general
election.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Service providers are hopeful that a more stable
business environment will have emerged in a year’s
time, but presently, given the lack of new work and
excess capacity at units, job losses were again reported.
Moreover, adding to the woes of service providers,
firms felt compelled to reduce their output charges for
the first time in over four years – despite input price
inflation remaining elevated as suppliers were again
reported to be reevaluating their list prices.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still, the inability to build sustainable upside suggests sellers remain in control, especially while price stays below the moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A move above 1.38394 would shift the near-term bias, but until then, rallies remain opportunities for sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taking a broader look at the daily chart, the next key target below the low price from Friday comes in at 1.37415 which represents the 61.8% retracement of the move up from the 2023 low. It is also near swing lows from mid-October before the price started to race into the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;654&quot; data-end=&quot;764&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another broader look from the daily chart has the back within the up-and-down consolidation range that prevailed from September 2022 until November 2024 (see red box on the chart below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;766&quot; data-end=&quot;781&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;782&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;782&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;784&quot; data-end=&quot;865&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance (risk/bias-defining): 1.38197 (100-hour MA), 1.38394 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;866&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;868&quot; data-end=&quot;905&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 1.3781 (low from April 14), 1.37698 (low from April 30), 1.37593 (low from May 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Investor Alert: 100% Tariff on Foreign Movies Announced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump has announced intentions to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced abroad entering the United States. Trump cited significant incentives offered by other countries to attract American filmmakers and studios, describing this as a threat to national security and domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative have been instructed to initiate this tariff process immediately. This development could significantly impact entertainment industry economics, international trade relations, and stock valuations within media and film production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should closely monitor companies heavily involved in international film production and distribution, as they could face increased costs and potential revenue disruption if such tariffs come into effect. Conversely, purely domestic studios and content producers might see relative benefits from reduced foreign competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot;&gt;Following the announcement by former President Donald Trump regarding a proposed 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies entering the United States, significant industry concerns have emerged around implementation specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key questions being raised include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-spread=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will movies partially produced overseas, including those with some filming or post-production activities abroad, fall under this tariff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are television series and streaming content, notably productions from major international operations like Netflix, subject to these tariffs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The context behind this tariff originates from recent discussions at Mar-a-Lago involving actors Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson, aiming to address the decline in U.S. entertainment industry employment. Initially, the discussions centered around enhancing federal tax incentives for domestic film production. The tariff proposal appears to be an escalation, potentially designed to aggressively redirect production back to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should anticipate significant scrutiny and debate over the tariff’s specifics, and closely monitor responses from major media and streaming companies with significant international footprints. The policy could potentially reshape competitive dynamics within the entertainment sector, impacting both domestic and global media markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for further updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should you buy the dip later at NFLX stock?

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;149&quot; data-end=&quot;264&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to struggle with upside momentum after repeated failures near key technical resistance levels last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;266&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last week, the pair attempted to break above the high extreme at 0.8333 and move toward the 38.2% retracement of the March–April decline at 0.83505, but sellers held firm. That resistance zone has capped gains on multiple occasions, as shown by the numbered rejections on the chart (see red numbered circles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;266&quot; data-end=&quot;556&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having said that, the move lower on Friday also held the support against key swing area between 0.8195 and 0.8212 before rebounding toward the new convergences of 100 and 200 hour moving averages currently at 0.8257 and 0.8263 (blue and green lines on the chart above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;558&quot; data-end=&quot;823&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier today, USDCHF briefly traded above its 100-hour (blue) and 200-hour (green) moving averages, but bullish momentum quickly faded. The pair has since rotated back lower and now trades below both moving averages, signaling a more bearish bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;825&quot; data-end=&quot;1187&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pair also sits in the lower half of its recent consolidation range, underscoring the bearish tilt in the near term. The inability to sustain gains above the moving averages keeps sellers in control, with focus now on the support zone near 0.8195–0.8212. A break below this area could open the door toward the next swing area and lows from late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1189&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1215&quot; data-end=&quot;1281&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1217&quot; data-end=&quot;1281&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8257 (100 hour moving average), 0.82636 (200 hour moving average)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1334&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1336&quot; data-end=&quot;1382&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8195-0.8212 (swing area support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
