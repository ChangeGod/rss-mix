                            &lt;p&gt;The US government is in the middle of discussing a generational tax cut and Moody&apos;s just voted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings agency downgraded the full faith and credit of the USA to Aa1 from Aaa. That means that all three ratings agencies have now removed the US top rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop comes a year after Moody&apos;s lowered its outlook on the US. That was a sign this could be coming but the usual 18-24 month guideline was spend up so that it would be lobbed at a high stakes time. Moody&apos;s says the new rating is stable but also highlights the obvious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on 
measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and 
growing interest costs,&quot; Moody&apos;s said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlighted the upcoming budget bill to note that it doesn&apos;t see any meaningful multi-year reductions in mandatory spending under the current proposals. With that, they say the USA&apos;s fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to other highly-rated sovereigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we recognize the US’ significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics,” Moody’s wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of one of those metrics, they see US dept-to-GDP rising to about 134% of GDP in 2035 compared to 98% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some very late moves in the market on this and I&apos;d expect it&apos;s negative for the dollar on Monday and positive for gold.&lt;/p&gt;

An earlier report about Japan balking at US trade negotiations didn&apos;t get much traction and the market was middling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It eventually sprang to life after the UMich report, which once again showed a dismal reading on consumer confidence but it was likely the continued surge in inflation expectations that caught the market&apos;s attention. That reversed a drop in yields and pared some of the Fed cut pricing seen in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the US dollar found some decent bids and EUR/USD sank to 1.1131 from 1.1200. It was a broad move in the dollar that included a rise in USD/JPY to 146.05 from 145.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the day wore on, some US dollar sellers returned but the moves were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger conclusion from markets this week is that the trade war has likely peaked, and I&apos;m on board with that thinking. That doesn&apos;t mean it will be easy from here. It was a refreshingly quiet week in the latter half as Trump went to the Middle East and that helped to lift risk assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s probably too much to ask for more of the same next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The big week for stock markets on the US-China climb-down is continuing late on Friday. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has edged to a fresh session high up 33 points, or 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading has been lighter late in the week but the momentum trade has continued to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, there isn&apos;t much (anything?) standing in the way of a return to the February highs. The AI trade is working again as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) US AND EU BREAK IMPASSE TO ENABLE TARIFF TALKS: FT

The US and EU have restarted trade talks to avoid Trump’s tariffs. Both sides exchanged proposals on tariffs, digital trade, and investment. EU officials warn some US tariffs on steel and cars will stay as the US reshoring push continues.

The EU has lagged behind other countries in striking deals. US negotiators demanded EU proposals or threatened full tariffs. Talks will focus on agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and trade imbalances.

The EU rejects US demands to weaken VAT and digital rules but may target Chinese goods to reduce dependence. EU ministers oppose a UK-style deal with lingering tariffs. Retaliatory measures remain on the table.</title>

      <title>(My Local Feed) TRUMP FLOATS PLAN TO IMPOSE NEW TARIFF RATES

After progress with the U.K. and China, President Trump said the U.S. will stop negotiating individual trade deals and will soon notify countries of new tariffs for doing business in the U.S.

Despite this, markets held steady, with stocks slightly up Friday afternoon. However, consumer sentiment remains near record lows, with inflation fears above 7%, according to a University of Michigan survey. Housing data also disappointed, with starts up just 1.6% and permits down 4.7%.

Still, investors remain optimistic, citing strong earnings and easing U.S.-China tensions. Goldman Sachs&apos; Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo noted that with tariffs sidelined for now, focus may shift to budget and tax issues.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRUMP FLOATS PLAN TO IMPOSE NEW TARIFF RATES&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After progress with the U.K. and China, President Trump said the U.S. will stop negotiating individual trade deals and will soon notify countries of new tariffs for doing business in the U.S.&lt;br&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a light week on the economic calendar with the S&amp;amp;P PMIs as the only real market movers. I expect more &apos;wait-and-see&apos; from the Fed speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from what&apos;s listed here, we will be waiting for the US to strike some trade deals and House Republicans are aiming to pass Trump&apos;s budget.

With market optimism running ahead of fundamentals, the Euro may struggle to hold its recent gains in the face of slowing inflows, geopolitical fragility, and macroeconomic headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;393&quot; data-end=&quot;408&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-start=&quot;410&quot; data-end=&quot;1211&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;410&quot; data-end=&quot;601&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;601&quot;&gt;Slowing Equity Inflows:European equity inflows have started to decelerate, reflecting persistent concerns over the Eurozone growth outlook, which could reduce demand for the EUR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;603&quot; data-end=&quot;805&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;606&quot; data-end=&quot;805&quot;&gt;Ongoing Geopolitical Risks:A durable ceasefire in Ukraine remains elusive.

                            &lt;p&gt;The opportunity to buy 30-year Treasuries yielding 5% briefly presented itself this week for the fourth time this year. All the other attempts were quickly beaten back and that same knee-jerk unfolded this time, driving yields to as low as 4.86% today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UMich report though seemed to underline ongoing angst about inflation and led to a bounce to 4.90%. If it holds, that will be the second-highest weekly close since October 2023 (the Liz Truss fiasco). Beyond that you need to go to before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the opportunity to buy bonds at these kinds of rates is rare and the market hasn&apos;t forgotten that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was probably some good news on the fiscal front for bonds today as some Republicans pushed back on the huge deficit increase that&apos;s coming in Trump&apos;s budget. That said, he&apos;s right to be highlighting that they&apos;re just grandstanding and will ultimately support it.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s the third consecutive weekly drop in rigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil market is in flux at the moment as OPEC brings back more barrels than anticipated and Trump zig-zags on trade policy. Natural gas is looking healthier though with days of US supply down about 18% y/y.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Someone the Federal Reserve system employs 26,000 people. That seems like an awful lot of people to manager currency, process checks and supervise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they&apos;ll be fine with a 10% haircut.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The vote failed in the Budget Committee, 16-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong belief in markets that they will twist the right arms in order to get it through when it matters. As it stands, this is putting the US on the path to another 1 or 1.5 percentage point increase in the deficit, or above 7% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The votes against it want to cut Medicaid, which looks like the battle ground at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like there won&apos;t be another vote today.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Closing changes on the day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +0.2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC +0.3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 +0.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex +0.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +0.4%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;German DAX, +1.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France&apos;s CAC +1.7%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK&apos;s FTSE 100 +1.5%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain&apos;s Ibex +3.6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Italy&apos;s FTSE MIB +3.1%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liberation Day declines have been nearly erased everywhere and Italy, Spain and Germany finished with record closing highs. I think this masks the extent of the battle that will unfold between the EU and US on trade, as I don&apos;t see any easy path to a compromise there.&lt;/p&gt;

The recent bounce is seen as tactical rather than structural, with longer-term headwinds intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;339&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-start=&quot;341&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;341&quot; data-end=&quot;551&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;344&quot; data-end=&quot;551&quot;&gt;Policy uncertainty persists:The pause in trade tensions is temporary. Policy direction remains erratic and could reintroduce volatility later this summer as deadlines and tariff suspensions expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;553&quot; data-end=&quot;741&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;556&quot; data-end=&quot;741&quot;&gt;Lingering economic drag:Even with de-escalation, the U.S. economy is now on a slower growth path than pre-trade war due to delayed investment and weakened business confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;743&quot; data-end=&quot;897&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;746&quot; data-end=&quot;897&quot;&gt;Current account deterioration:A narrowing U.S. current account surplus is reducing investment inflows and undermining support for the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;899&quot; data-end=&quot;1074&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;902&quot; data-end=&quot;1074&quot;&gt;Foreign asset reallocation:Institutional real money investors are reassessing exposure to U.S. assets and the dollar, contributing to persistent capital outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1076&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1079&quot; data-end=&quot;1262&quot;&gt;Fiscal uncertainty:An unpredictable fiscal trajectory adds risk, with potential implications for long-term Treasury issuance, inflation expectations, and investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1264&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1267&quot; data-end=&quot;1438&quot;&gt;Weaker-dollar bias from policymakers:The Trump administration continues to favor lower rates and a softer dollar, which adds to long-term depreciation pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1440&quot; data-end=&quot;1723&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1440&quot; data-end=&quot;1723&quot;&gt;BofA remains bearish on the USD, despite tactical reprieves. Structural forces—ranging from weaker capital inflows to policy unpredictability—are seen as increasingly difficult to reverse, suggesting a lower dollar over the medium term with a choppier path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1440&quot; data-end=&quot;1723&quot;&gt;For bank trade ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747495616851000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0FnVseEYgOaFgBrAnSWNdk&quot;&gt;check out eFX Plus&lt;/a&gt;.

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market presents a mixed bag of performances across various sectors. Let&apos;s delve into each area to understand the driving forces behind the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📈 Communication Services: Google (GOOG) surged by 1.98%, highlighting a strong performance in this sector. However, Meta (META) faced a decline of 1.69%, indicating divergent investor sentiments within digital platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📉 Semiconductors: The sector showed mixed signals with Nvidia (NVDA) inching up by 0.18% while Broadcom (AVGO) dropped by 1.99%. Concerns remain prevalent about overvaluations and potential supply chain disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🚀 Healthcare: A bright spot today, with Eli Lilly (LLY) leading the pack, gaining 2.40%. Robust drug pipeline news and strong earnings continue to fuel this sector&apos;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏦 Financials: A somewhat neutral day with Visa (V) increasing by 0.32% contrasted against JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slipping by 0.40%. Economic data and interest rate expectations are key factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🏗️ Industrials and Energy: Both sectors faced challenges, with Exxon (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) down by nearly 1%. This reflects broader concerns over energy demand fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market sentiment today seems cautiously optimistic, with investors balancing growth opportunities against potential risks. Lingering inflationary pressures and evolving global economic indicators add complexity to investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech stocks reveal volatility, illustrating a rotation in investor focus towards more stable and defensive areas like utilities and healthcare. Meanwhile, communication services display resilience, as shown by Google&apos;s robust performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider Diversification: With today&apos;s volatility, diversifying portfolios could be beneficial. Focus on balanced exposure across defensive sectors such as healthcare and emerging market technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch Market Indicators: Keep a close eye on economic data releases that might impact interest rates and sector movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore Growth Opportunities: Strong performers in the healthcare sector, particularly biotech, could offer attractive entry points for growth-oriented investors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these uncertain times, staying informed with real-time market updates and analysis is crucial. Whether you&apos;re a seasoned investor or a market novice, continued vigilance and strategic adjustments will be key to navigating today&apos;s dynamic market landscape.

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar is bid across the board at the moment as yields rebound from earlier lows. US 2-year yields were at 3.92% earlier today but have ticked up to 3.96%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has grown more-hesitant about pricing in rate cuts after the UMich consumer sentiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/umich-may-prelim-consumer-sentiment-508-vs-534-expected-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;showed a surge in inflation expectations. One-year inflation rose to 7.3% from 6.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s notable that this was mostly before Trump backtracked on China tariffs so these numbers will assuredly come down in the final report or next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could also be seeing some flows ahead of the 4 pm London fix, so keep an eye out for a USD reversal after that.&lt;/p&gt;

I would have expected to see some recovery after Trump reversed the Liberation Day tariffs but that didn&apos;t show up in this round. The pause in China tariffs should be a tailwind in the month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;This was out earlier but it&apos;s an important development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/45d52534-00a1-42d5-be46-486cf34fcfb8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that Japan is holding out for a better deal with the US, including a full removal of 25% auto tariffs. It says a deal is now unlikely to be reached before elections due in late July, which is beyond the 90-day delay the US imposed (expiration is July 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been reports this week that Japanese and South Korean deals would be soon announced, though there is a meeting still planned for next week and the G7 in Canada will be closely watched.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each side will set out its vision for a future ceasefire, in detail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Russia asked for Ukraine unconquered territory so the question is whether Ukraine wants to keep talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is from Axios:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Russian delegation demanded the complete withdrawal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 4 regions, and when the Ukrainians refused, ours stood up and declared that next time they would have to leave 5 (including Dnipropetrovsk)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&apos;t sound promising.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are up 0.2% today as today is the monthly equity and single-stock options expiration. Those who bought on April 7 are certainly feeling good about those calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields are coming down and that&apos;s taking away one risk from stock markets in what&apos;s been an incredible run. Trump&apos;s trip to the Middle East has also made it pleasantly quiet on the domestic front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gain today would be the 5th in a row and that comes on the heels of a nine-day rally that was only broken up by a small loss on May 9. There has only been one negative day since April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Future of Trading: The Rise of Novice to Pro Traders</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Funded trading has become a
ubiquitous offering in the retail space, helping empower traders of all levels
of expertise. With more opportunities than ever before, many traders are opting
to join funded trading programs, necessitating the need for reliable providers.
Finance Magnates checked in with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/2ucxmfja&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Axi Select&lt;/a&gt; for their take on its growing free
funded trader program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Axi group through the Axi
Select program provides funding and a structured pathway for traders to reach
their trading potential, while giving skilled traders a genuine platform to
become professional traders and forge careers. Greg Rubin- Head of Axi Select outlined
the group’s goals and program structure in an interview below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to
speak with us, let’s dive right in. I think we can all agree there is no
one-size-fits-all-approach to a trading journey. What advice do you have for
novice traders just looking to enter the retail space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency always trumps over big wins. Its best for new
traders to use a demo or low-risk live account to understand their edge. Nobody
needs to stop learning ever and we can all continue to do so for the rest of
our lives. We always encourage traders to treat this as a long-term
professional journey — not a get-rich-quick scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this point, are there any
pitfalls or traps newer traders should be cognizant of when embarking on this
experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Some basic things stick out as recurring
tendencies and should be avoided. This includes overleveraging, chasing the
market, and ignoring risk management. Each of which can be classified as the
most common traps. Unfortunately, many new traders also fall for expensive “get
funded quick” prop schemes with unrealistic expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Axi , with the Select program, our goal is to guide
traders with structure and transparency. We also provide tools like the Edge
Score — a proprietary system that helps traders understand their strengths and
weaknesses. The better the score, the more consistent and potentially
profitable the trader becomes. It’s a long-term framework built to help traders
grow sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empowering traders has
certainly been one of Axi Select’s core mandates. In what ways is the company
democratizing the route to becoming a professional trader?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axi Select removes the usual barriers and engenders every
trader with the power to succeed. There are no upfront costs, no evaluation
phases, and traders keep up to 90% of their profits. We offer real capital to
real traders to trade live markets, not simulations. If you show consistency,
we back you with funding — simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does Axi Select help
mitigate or avoid inherent risks in traditional prop trading?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many traditional prop firms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/2ucxmfja&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Axi Select&lt;/a&gt; is a capital
allocation program, backed by a regulated broker.  Traders can be assured of fund allocation and
profit payout once the program conditions are met. We don’t charge sign-up
fees, and traders trade their own strategies in live market conditions with
full transparency. It’s about alignment and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gap does prop trading fill compared to traditional
retail trading? In what ways is Axi Select a better option for traders compared
to other firms out there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to capital has been the bane of retail traders. Prop
firms or capital allocation programs have since stepped in to fill that void
albeit not effectively. Axi Select gives retail traders the best of both
worlds. The benefit of a brokerage platform with access to scale funding up to
$1M and up to 90% profit payouts . All this without registration fees or
restrictive market conditions. We focus on growth , trading skill development
and support — not quick churn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what impact has Axi Select made since its launch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen incredible momentum with thousands of traders on
the program. We have paid out over $5.6M+ since launch as profit to our
traders. Three traders have already reached the Pro-M stage — managing capital
allocations of $1 million US dollars each. And we’re just getting started!
We’ve also got a 22-yr old trader who recently made it as the 3rd
trader since launch to access up to $1M in funding. We continue to support
thousands of traders to develop real skills to harness the opportunity in the
market. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks seemed to wrap up too quickly for anything substantive though. We&apos;ll wait to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: This doesn&apos;t sound promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A Ukrainian diplomatic source said the Russian side demanded during the meeting that the Ukrainian army withdraws from several areas inside Ukraine in return for a ceasefire.&quot;Russian demands are detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed&quot;, the source said&lt;/blockquote&gt;
