                            &lt;p&gt;Leading CFD Broker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.easymarkets.com/au/?utm_source=forexlive&amp;amp;utm_medium=press+release&amp;amp;utm_content=easymarkets+homepage&amp;amp;utm_campaign=q1+trading+trends+and+triumphs+article+2025&amp;amp;utm_ef_channel=push&amp;amp;gid=6601483&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;easyMarkets&lt;/a&gt;,
released its Q1 2025 market recap, revealing key trends in global trading
behaviours and highlighting significant developments across various
sectors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
Gold, Nasdaq, and EURUSD remain the top
assets for the third consecutive quarter, with gold reaching near-record
highs, closing in on $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
The crypto market saw a decline in Q1 2025
after strong momentum in 2024, as regulatory expectations for the crypto sector
were not met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
European indices surged, driven by
increased defence spending amidst rising geopolitical tensions, attracting
attention from traders seeking new opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·     
The Asia Pacific region saw a marked
increase in trading volumes, with local traders actively shaping global trends
in traditional assets and global indices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform upgrades and risk management shifts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;easyMarkets launched key upgrades to its web and mobile
platform, enhancing the overall user experience. In addition, the company
observed a slight decline in the use of Guaranteed Stop Loss orders, indicating
that traders are adjusting their risk management strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikos Antoniades, CEO of easyMarkets, commented: “Our
clients’ shift from crypto to European indices highlights how quickly they are
adapting to macroeconomic developments. At easyMarkets, we are committed to
providing the tools and stability traders need to stay agile in a fast-moving
market.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As global geopolitical tensions and U.S. political
developments continue to shape market sentiment, easyMarkets is confident that
its clients will continue to capitalise on new opportunities in Q2 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on easyMarkets&apos; Q1 2025 performance and

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;They are part of the six countries that the US had shortlisted to be a priority for trade negotiations. So, yeah. The first round of talks is expected on 7 May. For some context, the other countries on that list are India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and the UK. So, let&apos;s see how things go later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have intervened appropriately&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But degree of intervention in FX market is smaller than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have warned those who are trying to speculate in the market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small and medium-sized exporters joined larger firms in selling US dollar positions today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;They don&apos;t manipulate but they do intervene. Same difference, no? In any case, this will be an interesting spot with regards to dollar sentiment so just keep an eye out in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dollar stays pinned down on the session</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s a brand new week but we&apos;re seeing the same old story play out as it has been in the past few weeks. The dollar is once again on the backfoot as risk sentiment cools off as well on the day. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.9% but it&apos;s a mere breather after nine straight days of gains. And even during that period, the dollar has struggled to keep its footing for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;USD/JPY is now down 0.7% on the day to 143.95 while EUR/USD is up 0.3% to 1.1336 on the day. USD/CHF is also down 0.3% to 0.8243 after a brief jump earlier to 0.8270 following the Swiss inflation data. Meanwhile, AUD/USD is up 0.6% to 0.6483 and threatening a technical break to the upside above its 200-day moving average:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 0.6500 mark will see some offers in play but as things stand, dollar sentiment remains the prime driver of price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s early in the week but trade headlines will continue to dominate proceedings and drive further changes in the dollar through the week. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/surging-twd-fuelling-revaluation-talk-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;latest situation involving Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; is certainly keeping things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;If we are to start crossing the boundaries of revaluation in currencies with regards to trade talks, it will have a lot of spillover effects. That especially when it comes to broader sentiment involving the dollar and emerging markets in Asia as well. That&apos;s something to be mindful of in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protectionism threatens to weaken prosperity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All economists agree that free trade is much better for economic growth than protectionism. With free trade you have better efficiency through comparative advantage, access to larger markets, increased competition, lower inflation, more foreign investment and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

There have been some positive signs on US-China tariff talks but more concrete resolutions would be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

The Taiwan central bank is also out saying that they are not involved in tariff talks and that there has been no discussion on the exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The worrying part of this now is that what does this actually mean for domestic players? Exporters and life insurance firms are being caught out here as they are underhedged. The latter due to their exposure in US bonds naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s going to be an interesting next few days at least.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, investor sentiment remains at a low level but at least the outsized fears have diminished. The expectations index also jumped up to 19.6, up from 3.8 in April previously. Sentix notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;This is remarkable, as it shows that investors have largely abandoned the recession fears they expressed last month. The main victims of Trump&apos;s tariffs policy are the US economy, and ,to some extent, the economies of China and Switzerland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The S&amp;P 500 erased the entire drop since April 2. Now what?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;It was another good day for the US stock markets last Friday as the S&amp;amp;P 500 index extended the gains following the positive NFP report and managed to erase the entire drop since &quot;Liberation Day&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now is how much further this rally can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer revolves around the first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We erased all the losses because the market expected de-escalation and eventually much lower tariff rates given the 10% baseline adopted after the pause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s pretty obvious now that the Fed won&apos;t do anything unless the labour market weakens notably and by then it will be already late. So, the ball remains in Trump&apos;s court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path of least resistance remains to the upside but we are now at a point where a disappointment could hurt sentiment and trigger another correction to the downside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were told that the first trade deal would have been announced by the end of this week. If we don&apos;t get anything, then the market might take it as a disappointment and further gains would start to be questioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging by the comments from other countries, 10% might now be seen as too high anyway, so higher tariff rates will likely trigger another selloff on expectations of retaliations and more uncertainty. That&apos;s the worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best case scenario would be 5% or lower rates, in which instance we would have very high chances of seeing the S&amp;amp;P 500 rallying into a new all-time high. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the latest inflation reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/switzerland-april-cpi-00-vs-02-yy-expected-20250505/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like the SNB will have little choice but to mark a return back to negative rates. Headline annual inflation is back to zero for the first time since March 2021 while core annual inflation is also slowly nudging lower. If you strip out rent from the price calculation, inflation is in fact already in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The worst part in all this is that a stronger Swiss franc will only add further downside pressure to imported inflation - which has been negative for 18 straight months now. The signs are all pointing to deflation returning and the SNB has to step up to the plate to try and not fall back into the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The current policy rate is at 0.25% with the next meeting set for 19 June. A 25 bps rate cut is fully priced in for that but at this stage, I would argue that one shouldn&apos;t rule out a 50 bps move (~8% priced in). The Swiss central bank has to act to send a strong message but considering the global outlook, even that might not be enough to stop this tidal wave from continuing to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The dollar&apos;s plight has only exacerbated safety flows into the franc currency and even if the SNB resorts to intervention efforts, it will be tough to stem the tide. They are definitely in an unenviable position at the moment. And still, they will have little choice but to accept a return to negative rates or the backlash would be even worse to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Oil Futures Analysis Today with orderFlow Intel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time of Analysis: Monday, May 5, 2025, 9:36 AM (Central European Summer Time, GMT+2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Order Flow Overview for Crude Oil Futures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude Oil futures exhibit a clear bullish momentum supported by robust buyer activity and delta strength, based on comprehensive order flow intel. Persistent positive cumulative delta and substantial bullish shifts in delta reveal a dominant bullish sentiment at current price levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Order Flow Observations So Far Today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong bullish delta developments at critical trading periods, notably at 01:51 and recent bars at 08:00 and 09:14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued buyer strength is shown through significant Delta SL readings (621 at 08:00 and 551 at 09:14), suggesting robust absorption of any selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutional activity is inferred from higher trade counts, particularly evident at the 08:00 bar, suggesting professional accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important Levels for Today&apos;s Crude Oil Futures Trading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sustain bullish momentum, price must remain above these critical intraday reference points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Developing VWAP: 56.21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s VAL: 55.96&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding above these levels strongly supports the bullish rebound scenario. A breakdown below would signal weakening buyer strength and possible bearish pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullish Targets and Resistance Levels for Crude Oil Futures Today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s Initial Target: 57.37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent Target (Potentially beyond today): 58.17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important Resistance Zones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;58.56: Slightly below Friday&apos;s VWAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;58.86: Friday&apos;s Value Area High (VAH)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels represent significant resistance and are potential targets if bullish momentum persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Order Flow Prediction &amp;amp; Confidence for Oil Traders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction Score: +6 (Moderate Bullish Bias, Strong Confidence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trader Action Plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders should watch carefully for price confirmation above VWAP (56.21) and VAL (55.96) to maintain a bullish bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial upside focus should be placed on today&apos;s POC at 56.76, with stronger bullish confirmation seen upon a decisive move toward the first bullish target at 57.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement vigilant risk management around critical psychological price points to mitigate potential volatility or false breakout scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:

      <title>Market Outlook for the week of May 5th - May 9th</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s going to be a light week for economic events, as is usually the case following the release of the U.S. non-farm employment change data. On Monday, the U.S. will publish the ISM services PMI, and on Tuesday, its trade balance data which typically doesn’t attract much attention but is worth watching given the current tariff-related tensions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, New Zealand will release its quarterly employment change and unemployment rate and later in the day we&apos;ll have the highlight of the week—the FOMC monetary policy announcement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England’s monetary policy decision will follow up on Thursday, while the U.S. will get the unemployment claims report. The following day, Canada will release its own employment change and unemployment rate figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarks from several FOMC members are expected throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the U.S., the consensus for the ISM services PMI is 50.2, down from the prior 50.8. The outlook for the services sector is not very promising but compared to the manufacturing sector, it is still expected to remain in expansionary territory for now. This release will also provide insight into how tariffs are being absorbed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month’s drop was one of the largest in nine months, driven by a significant decline in the employment component and a slowdown in both domestic and international orders, according to analysts from Wells Fargo. Although business activity remained relatively resilient, the overall picture is less encouraging, and further deterioration in business confidence could weigh heavily on the sector.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional Fed surveys have echoed signs of weakening service activity, while ongoing uncertainty around investment and supply chains continues to drag on growth momentum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this week&apos;s FOMC meeting, the Fed is widely expected to keep rates on hold despite the latest economic data, particularly the soft Q1 GDP figures.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The labor market remains stable, and strong income growth continues to support consumer spending. However, analysts from Wells Fargo point out several cautionary signals: equity markets have declined, credit spreads have widened, and both consumer and business sentiment reflect growing concerns, especially regarding rising input costs and hesitation around investment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed will likely adopt a “wait and see” stance as the Committee evaluates the current economic landscape. There is no doubt that tariffs complicate the Fed’s mandate, exerting pressure on both inflation and employment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders will closely watch for clues on how policymakers are balancing these risks. Wells Fargo analysts expect the Fed to begin lowering rates once tariffs start materially impacting hard economic data. They anticipate the first 25 bps rate cut to come in June, though they note this outlook could shift if trade tensions ease through carve-outs or new deals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this week&apos;s meeting, the BoE is expected to deliver a 25 bps rate cut, lowering the policy rate to 4.25%. This move would continue the easing cycle of quarterly cuts that began in mid-2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, U.K. data suggest some resilience in economic activity, and the Bank is expected to proceed cautiously. Traders will closely watch the updated Monetary Policy Report for insights into whether recent developments, such as the introduction of U.S. tariffs, are factored into the BoE’s outlook.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significantly weaker growth forecast or inflation projections well below the 2% target would likely be required to shift expectations toward a faster pace of rate cuts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the consensus for the employment change is 24.5K, compared to the prior -32.6K, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 6.7%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian labor market conditions have started to show signs of strain following the imposition of U.S. tariffs in March. Employment declined, and a second consecutive monthly drop in the participation rate was recorded, with the unemployment rate rising to 6.7%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the labor market hasn’t collapsed—unemployment remains below the 6.9% peak recorded late last year—ongoing softness in hiring demand, as indicated by declining job vacancies, suggests further deterioration ahead. RBC analysts expect the unemployment rate to gradually rise through the second half of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDJPY Technical Analysis – Focus on the FOMC and the first trade deal</title>

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USD continues to be
supported in the short-term as we head into the FOMC decision and the first
trade deal. This has most likely to do with positioning rather than
fundamentals. The short dollar trade got very overstretched so positive news on
the tariff front and good economic data is providing a pullback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside seems to be
limited for now as the Fed is likely to reiterate its commitment for just two
rate cuts this year unless the labour market weakens notably. The NFP report
last Friday, was much better than expected, so it gives the Fed a reason to
keep its neutral stance for now. In the medium term though, the US Dollar
should keep on depreciating as the path of least resistance for the Fed remains
to cut rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the JPY side, the
currency has been driven mainly by global events rather than domestic
fundamentals. Alongside the Swiss Franc, it’s been the favoured safe haven in
the currencies space amid the swings in risk sentiment. On the monetary policy
front, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-japan-leaves-policy-unchanged-as-widely-expected-20250501/&quot;&gt;BoJ&lt;/a&gt; kept interest rates unchanged as expected and
delivered a dovish message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was then echoed by BoJ
Governor Ueda which placed a great deal on trade developments. In summary, the
central bank is likely to go faster on rate hikes in case we get a good trade
deal and delay rate adjustments in case the trade deal disappoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that USDJPY continues to pull back from the key 140.00 handle. From a risk
management perspective, the sellers will have a better risk to reward setup
around the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/&quot;&gt;trendline&lt;/a&gt; to position for further
downside, while the buyers will look for a break higher to increase the bullish
bets into the 151.00 handle next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we have a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;
zone around the 144.00 handle where we can also find the upward minor trendline
for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/technical-analysis-confluence-20220318/&quot;&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt;.
This is where we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the
trendline to position for a rally into the major trendline. The sellers, on the
other hand, will look for a break below the trendline to invalidate the bullish
setup and pile in for a drop back into the 140.00 handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDJPY Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, there’s
not much else we can add here as the price is testing the support zone. The
buyers might want to split their orders and lean on both the support and the
trendline. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to wait for a break below
the trendline before increasing the bearish bets. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, we get the US ISM Services PMI. On Wednesday, we
have the FOMC Rate Decision. On Thursday, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures.
On Friday, we conclude the week with the Japanese wage data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below&lt;/p&gt;

Market Bias: Bullish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;tradeCompass Key Levels for Gold Futures Today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of this analysis, gold futures are trading at $3,268.2, slightly above today&apos;s VWAP of $3,264.5, reinforcing the bullish scenario according to tradeCompass methodology.

Meanwhile, core inflation is also seen slowing further and that will add worry for the SNB amid a stronger franc currency in the past month or so. Deflation is back on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the main highlight is the Swiss CPI which is expected at 0.2% Y/Y. The data is unlikely to change much interest rates expectations as the market is already pricing in a pretty dovish path with a return to negative rates. We will likely need a big deviation from the expected numbers to trigger a repricing, with an upside surprise likely having a larger impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, the focus will switch to the US ISM Services PMI. The regional reports have been showing weakness as many other consumer and business surveys due to the trade uncertainty. The consensus sees a drop to 50.2 vs. 50.8 prior but following the strong NFP report, it&apos;s unlikely to see the market pricing in a more dovish path ahead of the FOMC decision on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus this week will be on the first trade deal announcement. As a reminder, US officials said that the first trade deal would have been announced last week or this one. If we don&apos;t get anything this week either, then the market might get disappointed and start questioning the optimism that got priced in in the last couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

US futures are holding lower though but that is perhaps some exhaustion after nine straight days of gains. That itself is a rarity and turning from that to ten days is one even more so, as seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/its-been-a-long-time-since-the-sp-500-was-up-this-many-days-in-a-row-20250502/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In case you missed the weekend news: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/opec-to-accelerate-oil-output-hikes-warns-of-ending-voluntary-cuts-if-compliance-lags-20250504/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;OPEC+ to accelerate oil output hikes, warns of ending voluntary cuts if compliance lags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Amid worries of tariffs weighing on global growth and the US-China trade war still not seeing much progress, the decision by OPEC+ is not doing oil prices any favours at the moment. The bloc is fixated now in its battle to try and secure market share and push out US shale it would seem. The question is, where will the line be drawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The April low stands at $55.15 but we could be eyeing a steeper decline if all the factors above continue to stay the course over the next few weeks. Not quite the time to go bottom picking just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FX option expiries for 5 May 10am New York cut</title>

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are just a few to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;They are for EUR/USD at the 1.1300 and 1.1400 levels, with price action sitting right in between the expiries at the moment. They are notable but not likely to offer much impact though, as they don&apos;t tie in to any technical significance. The ones at 1.1300 might help to limit downside price action while upside is more contained by the key hourly moving averages at 1.1340-53 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, risk flows and dollar sentiment will continue to outweigh any impact from the expiries still. For today, the dollar is weak with the risk mood leaning towards the softer side. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures are down 0.7% and that&apos;s seeing the dollar down across the board as well. So, those are the more important things to note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That will see some reduced flows in Europe to start the week, especially after a handful of holidays in Asia as well. However, other major European hubs are all open in the region. In terms of data releases, there won&apos;t be too much on the agenda though. We have Swiss inflation data for April at 0630 GMT and then Eurozone Sentix investor confidence for May at 0830 GMT. That&apos;s about it before we move on to US trading later.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;How one picture has come to define the nature of the relationship between the two. Poetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But essentially, it does sum up the situation as we look towards the FOMC meeting this week. The Fed, staying as independent as they are, will most certainly keep interest rates unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The economy is no doubt softening but not quite at a point yet to push policymakers to react too strongly. That especially when price pressures (PCE especially) are still keeping up as well. The backdrop of that against the potential impact of tariffs is definitely keeping the Fed on its toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As things stand, markets are not pricing in a rate cut whatsoever for this week. The odds of any change to rates are at ~2% currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In his last few comments about Powell, Trump has said that he has no intention to fire the man. And he reaffirmed that over the weekend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/weekend-trump-said-he-wont-remove-powell-before-his-term-ends-in-may-2026-20250504/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But mind you, he still found the time to tweet out on the weekend that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD LOWER ITS RATE!!!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;And so when the Fed doesn&apos;t this week, we&apos;ll see how sharp Trump&apos;s gaze on Powell will be. I wouldn&apos;t rule out seeing another barrage of comments from Trump bashing Powell about that decision to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;When he does, that will just bring us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/and-round-and-round-we-go-20250423/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;back on the merry-go-round&lt;/a&gt; once again.&lt;/p&gt;

This latest move is nearly triple some early expectations and marks the second straight month of accelerated supply increases. I’ve grouped the OPEC+ posts above — be sure to read the final one, which offers a counterpoint to the prevailing market narrative, even if it’s not being fully priced in yet.
→ Oil prices gapped lower as trading reopened for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;838&quot; data-end=&quot;925&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trump’s Headlines:
The U.S. President made multiple headlines over the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;926&quot; data-end=&quot;1140&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;926&quot; data-end=&quot;1004&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;928&quot; data-end=&quot;1004&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tariffs with China will come lower eventually &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;926&quot; data-end=&quot;1004&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;928&quot; data-end=&quot;1004&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Plans to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies (see post above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1005&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1007&quot; data-end=&quot;1077&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Confirmed he won’t remove Fed Chair Powell before his term ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1078&quot; data-end=&quot;1140&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1080&quot; data-end=&quot;1140&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Said he has no plans to speak with Xi Jinping this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1142&quot; data-end=&quot;1617&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;FX – Taiwan Dollar and Regional Moves:
The Taiwan dollar was again the standout mover, following its historic surge on Friday. MUFG described that move as a 19-standard deviation event — statistically implausible under normal market models, and yet… here we are. (I’ve grouped the TWD posts; the second one offers a good breakdown of why such moves can occur in FX, despite the math.)
TWD surged again today, driven by speculation of revaluation pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1619&quot; data-end=&quot;1910&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This theme isn’t confined to Taiwan. There’s growing chatter that some Asian countries may be considering currency revaluation as a strategic lever in tariff negotiations — a stronger currency makes exports more expensive, potentially addressing U.S. complaints. Supporting the theory:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1911&quot; data-end=&quot;2111&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1911&quot; data-end=&quot;2020&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1913&quot; data-end=&quot;2020&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The offshore yuan (still trading despite China’s holiday) hit its strongest level since November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2021&quot; data-end=&quot;2111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2023&quot; data-end=&quot;2111&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Hong Kong dollar again touched the strong end of its permitted trading band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2113&quot; data-end=&quot;2200&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gold:
Gold prices firmed during Asian trade but have since given back some gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2113&quot; data-end=&quot;2200&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2113&quot; data-end=&quot;2200&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Oil:&lt;/p&gt;
