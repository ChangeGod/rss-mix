Momentum above the 100- and 200-hour moving averages has repeatedly faded, highlighting persistent selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;393&quot; data-end=&quot;692&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since mid-late April, price action has carved out a sideways range, with the support zone between 0.8195 and 0.8212 holding on multiple tests.

Until then, sellers remain in control, and downside probes into the lower support zone remain a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices are trading higher in early US trading. The gains were helped by the US/China meeting news, but the levels are lower than premarket levels implied by the futures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow industrial average is leading the way with a gain of 0.56%. The S&amp;amp;P index is up 0.47% and the NASDAQ index is up 0.40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Bessent will be speaking on Capitol Hill. His comments are expected to begin very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the S&amp;amp;P and NASDAQ indices remain just above their rising 50 hour moving average. For the S&amp;amp;P index the 50 arm of which is at 5596.31. The low price today raised 5613.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the NASDAQ index it&apos;s 50 hour moving averages at 17622.12. They low price reached 17689.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the indices also held above the moving average which increases the levels importance from a technical perspective. If there is a break look for momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Time is ticking, but the tariff war remains unclear with
Donald Trump suddenly declaring that he does not plan to talk to Xi Jinping
this week, and adding that China is “stealing” from the U.S. In short, there is
still no trade deal in sight between the two world powers, which is not good
news for markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the US rejected Japan&apos;s request to lift
tariffs altogether, a move that did not please investors either. As a result,
both the Nasdaq and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SPX/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P
500 started the week in the red&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly expected
reaction. Who knows, we may see another rally in Treasury yields if the deal
fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, however, markets have followed a similar
pattern: an initial wave of pessimism followed by a rebound. Some see this as
reminiscent of the Biden era. The problem is that back then, investors were
pinning their hopes on the next interest rate cut, which now seems less likely
as inflation risks increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the “buy the dips” approach last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start by remembering that past performance does not
guarantee future results. Therefore, expecting the rally to continue just
because it has happened in the past is a risky bet. Moreover, analysts don&apos;t
seem too confident that recent gains will be sustained, as trade wars have
already hurt the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not just the drop in GDP in the first quarter, caused
mainly by a widening trade deficit due to increased imports by businesses
before tariffs went into effect, but the fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-plunges-april-2025-04-29/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20April%2029%20(Reuters),lowest%20reading%20since%20May%202020.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;U.S.
consumer confidence index fell&lt;/a&gt; to 86.0 in April from
93.9 previously. The current situation index also fell to 133.5 from 134.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the U.S. S&amp;amp;P Global Composite PMI index fell to
50.6 in April from 53.5 in March, its lowest reading since September 2023.
Business expectations fell to their lowest level in two and a half years, and
employment numbers were virtually flat. Not surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;XAUUSD is returning to an uptrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this increasingly points to a slowdown in the
economic cycle, and worse, it may be accompanied by a pickup in inflation due
to tariffs. This would likely push the Fed to adopt a more aggressive monetary
policy. In the short term, this should raise doubts about current market
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing: macroeconomic uncertainty makes it
difficult for companies to provide clear guidance. Take Tesla, for example. In
its latest earnings report, the company declined to give a full-year outlook,
saying it would wait until second-quarter results to update investors, and
money doesn&apos;t like unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the bottom line? Keep your eyes open and be prepared
for possible turnarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of the times, the members of the administration preface most comments with &quot;The President wants to...&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just an interesting shift which I may be overempasizing, but....&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is reporting that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU is to announce provisional list of tariffs against the US on Thursday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU tariffs to be enforced if talks with the US fail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headlines mirror an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/eu-reportedly-eyes-tariffs-on-boeing-if-trade-talks-with-us-go-south-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;earlier report &lt;/a&gt;that indicated the EU is reportedly preparing a list of roughly €100 billion in annual U.S. imports—including Boeing aircraft—that could face tariffs if trade negotiations with the U.S. break down. While the move is seen as potential retaliation for ongoing U.S. tariffs, any measures would still require approval from EU member states. The proposed list is expected to be circulated within the next day but remains subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;104&quot; data-end=&quot;328&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the past six trading days, USDCAD has followed a pattern of making new lows every other day—last Wednesday, last Friday, and again yesterday (Tuesday). If that pattern continues, it would suggest that today will not see a new low. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;330&quot; data-end=&quot;539&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, each of these new lows has been quickly reversed, indicating a negative bias but lacking strong downside momentum. Notably, the recent lows mark the weakest levels for USDCAD since October 2024, yet momentum has not been strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;541&quot; data-end=&quot;877&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the topside, each rebound following a low—Thursday and again on Monday—has managed to push the pair above both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, even if only briefly. However, today’s rebound from yesterday’s low has so far stalled below the 100-hour moving average at 1.38095. The 200-hour moving average sits above at 1.38251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For bullish momentum to build, the price will need to break back above both of those key moving averages, and stay above those moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fundamentally, Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, met with former President Trump and described the discussions as productive. However, Carney firmly stated that “Canada is not for sale” and highlighted concerns regarding the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from Canada’s perspective. He also emphasized Canada’s intent to diversify its trade relationships beyond North America. In response to these developments, the Canadian dollar has weakened, putting upward pressure on USDCAD - of late.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Will that bias end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;879&quot; data-end=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get and stay above the 100/200 hour MAs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The economic calendar in the North American session is void of economic releases. The only release will be by the EE IA with their weekly while inventory data. The expectations are for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil -0.833M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasoline -1.6000M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distilates -1.271M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private data released late yesterday showed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the Fed, the decision will be announced at 2 PM ET with the press conference starting at 2:30 PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;385&quot; data-end=&quot;440&quot;&gt;No rate change expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;445&quot; data-end=&quot;548&quot;&gt;Balance sheet policy also likely to remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus will be on forward guidance and the Fed&apos;s data-dependent posture amid policy uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions will likely center on the expectations for policy given the tariffs and its potential impact on growth/inflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;79&quot; data-end=&quot;335&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fed Chair Powell has remained committed to a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach, relying on incoming data before making any policy shifts. So far, that strategy has worked, as hard data continues to hold up. However, the full impact of new tariffs has yet to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;337&quot; data-end=&quot;625&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As time passes without resolution, companies will be forced to make pricing decisions, and supply chains could face renewed strain. While employment trends may help absorb some inflationary pressure, broader effects may begin to surface. The U.S. economy is a complex mix of moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;627&quot; data-end=&quot;822&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For now, the job market remains resilient—this week’s initial jobless claims data will be closely watched. While soft data continues to show weakness, the hard data still paints a stable picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing in a 30% chance for a cut at the June meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury auctioned off three notes on Monday and 10 year notes on Tuesday. Both were met with pretty decent demand. Today, they will refrain from auctioning off the 30-year bonds to stay away from the FOMC rate decision volatility.  The 30 year bonds will be auctioned off tomorrow at 1 PM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer credit will also be released at 3 PM this afternoon with expectations of $9.50 billion increase versus the modest -0.81 billion decrease last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US stocks are modestly higher  in premarket trading as the market reacts positively to the US/China trade talks. The features are employing a 19.34 point rise in the S&amp;amp;P. Yields are higher in the short end with the two-year up 2.5 basis points. The 30-year bond is down -1.9 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The USD is higher vs the 3 major currency pairs to start the US session (by differing amounts of course). Overnight, it was announced that the US and China would meet in Switzerland to break the ice on trade.  It is a step in the right direction but as many have stressed, the negotiations with China will be drawn out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Reserve will meet today and announce no change in rates. The focus will be on what Fed Chair Powell says and the FOMC statement. There will be no central tendencies or dot plots. For the June meeting, the market is pricing in around a 30% chance of a cut of 25 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stocks are higher in reaction after two days of declines to start the trading week.  US yields are modestly higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video below looks at the technicals that are driving the 3 major currency pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the US stock market is showing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow Industrial Average  up 264 points after falling -389 points or -0.95%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P up 32 points after falling -43.47 points or -0.77% yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq index up 115 points after falling -154.58 points or -0.87% yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US debt market, the yields are higher:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield 3.815% +2.7 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 3.920%, +2.3 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield 4.323%, +0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield 4.801%, -1.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil and is up $0.60 or 1.03% at $59.70&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold is rotating back to the downside by -$48 or -1.42% at $3388.70&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver is trading down $0.26 or -0.83% at $32.91&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is trading up $173 and $96,987&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The headlines overnight helped to give US futures a bump as well as the dollar. And that mostly stayed the course in European morning trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The greenback did give back some of its gains though, with EUR/USD turning back to near flat levels at 1.1363 currently. USD/JPY was one that held up, easing a little to 142.90 before coming back up to 143.33 at the moment. Besides that, USD/CAD is up 0.1% to 1.3793 and AUD/USD down 0.3% to 0.6470 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Overall, it&apos;s not much but at least a minor victory for the dollar - for now anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;As for US futures, the gains mostly held with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures seen up 0.6%. That&apos;s off the earlier high of gains of a little over 1% though, with market players keeping more tentative as China reaffirmed that their position hasn&apos;t changed ahead of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;European indices were less enthused though, as we&apos;re yet to see much of any progress in talks between the EU and US at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In other markets, gold is down as the risk mood is holding up with the precious metal easing back under $3,400 on the day. Meanwhile, oil is also marked higher amid the better trade news as WTI crude tests the $60 mark during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Coming up, we&apos;ll have to navigate through more trade headlines but there is also the FOMC meeting decision to scrutinise. How will Trump respond when the Fed decides to keep rates unchanged later? We&apos;ll have to see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons in Patience and Adaptability from EBC’s Trading Challenge II, Week 9</title>
      <link>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/lessons-in-patience-and-adaptability-from-ebcs-trading-challenge-ii-week-9-20250507/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 11:30:16 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.forexlive.com/Education/lessons-in-patience-and-adaptability-from-ebcs-trading-challenge-ii-week-9-20250507/</guid>
      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;At EBC Financial Group, we see firsthand how rapidly
evolving markets test the resolve and skill of traders. Week 9 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebcfin.co.uk/&quot;&gt;EBC’s Million Dollar Trading Challenge II&lt;/a&gt;
was a vivid example: gold and forex pairs swung sharply, leaderboards shifted
overnight, and traders faced a landscape where yesterday’s strategies no longer
guaranteed tomorrow’s results. In such an environment, three qualities stand
out as essential for success: adaptability, strategic patience, and the power
of community-driven trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptability: Thriving Amid Uncertainty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatility is a double-edged sword. It creates risk but also
opens the door to opportunity for those who can adapt quickly. Our top
performers in Week 9-like @forexwatchbrother and @willsdad-did not cling to a single
approach. Instead, they shifted between gold and key currency pairs,
capitalising on reversals and adjusting their tactics as conditions changed. This
willingness to pivot is what separates resilient traders from those who are
left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Patience: Knowing When to Act-and When to Wait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fast-moving market, it’s tempting to chase every swing.
Yet, as @songqiantongzi demonstrated, sometimes the wisest move is to wait for
the right opportunity. Strategic patience is not about inaction; it’s about
discipline-knowing when to step back and when to strike. This approach
preserves capital, reduces emotional trading, and positions traders to make the
most of high-conviction setups when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-Driven Trading: Learning and Growing Together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful development in today’s trading
landscape is the rise of community-driven platforms like EBC’s zero-fee copy
trading. By enabling traders to replicate the strategies of top performers in
real time, we lower the barrier to entry and democratise access to proven
expertise. Our five-dimensional signal rating system and transparent
performance dashboards empower both new and experienced traders to make informed
choices, diversify their approach, and learn from each other’s successes and setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collective learning is not just a feature-it’s a
foundation. As more traders engage with the community, share insights, and
follow disciplined leaders, the benefits multiply: risk is spread, knowledge is
deepened, and everyone has the chance to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Standard for Volatile Markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons from Week 9 are clear: adaptability, patience,
and community engagement are not just nice-to-haves-they are non-negotiable for
success in volatile markets. At EBC, we are committed to fostering an environment
where these qualities thrive, backed by robust technology, world-class regulation,
and a transparent, supportive community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As volatility continues to define the trading landscape, we
encourage every trader to embrace change, act with discipline, and leverage the
collective wisdom of the EBC community. In doing so, you are not just surviving
the storm-you are learning to navigate it with confidence and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

With the announcement expected at 2:00 p.m. ET and the press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET, this analysis helps you prepare for potential volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;863&quot; data-end=&quot;1253&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is gold about to do? That’s the big question on every trader’s mind. While the broader trend remains bullish, today&apos;s market behavior is largely influenced by caution, tight volume clusters, and key levels holding firm. The tradeCompass methodology can help guide your decision-making by mapping the important bullish and bearish thresholds — keeping you open to both outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1260&quot; data-end=&quot;1302&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Intraday Price Levels to Watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1304&quot; data-end=&quot;1337&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1306&quot; data-end=&quot;1337&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Developing VWAP: $3,394.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1338&quot; data-end=&quot;1391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1340&quot; data-end=&quot;1391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current Volume Point of Control (POC): $3,400&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1392&quot; data-end=&quot;1430&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1394&quot; data-end=&quot;1430&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s VWAP &amp;amp; POC: $3,390&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1431&quot; data-end=&quot;1477&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1433&quot; data-end=&quot;1477&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current Value Area: $3,381.5 to $3,407&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1478&quot; data-end=&quot;1570&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1480&quot; data-end=&quot;1570&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Important Overhead Level: $3,422.8 (Value Area Low from April 22, all-time high day)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1571&quot; data-end=&quot;1630&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1573&quot; data-end=&quot;1630&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key Lower Support Level: $3,366.2 (Yesterday’s VAL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1631&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1633&quot; data-end=&quot;1671&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Critical Bearish Threshold: $3,350&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1678&quot; data-end=&quot;1721&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;tradeCompass Thresholds &amp;amp; Scenarios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1723&quot; data-end=&quot;1767&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Upside Breakout Threshold: $3,422.8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1769&quot; data-end=&quot;1968&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This marks the Value Area Low from April 22, when gold hit its all-time high.

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 78 bps (99% probability of no change at today&apos;s announcement)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 62 bps (92% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 94 bps (91% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 48 bps (54% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 110 bps (97% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 72 bps (67% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 44 bps (99% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 10 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change happened with the SNB pricing as dovish comments from SNB officials and the lower than expected Swiss inflation data reinforced the expectations for the central bank to go back to negative rates. That&apos;s been weighing on the CHF especially amid a better risk mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the first trade deal will have a big impact on interest rates expectations and that&apos;s what the market is waiting for at the moment. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;best case scenario&lt;/a&gt;, we could even see the market price in just one rate cut for the Fed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that as the stock market rebounded on positive expectations for trade deals, so did Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is driven by the same macro factors that influence the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now in a bit of a consolidation as we await the next key catalyst which will likely be the details of the first trade deal. Everything revolves around that because on the rates front, the Fed is not going to cut amid this uncertainty until the labour market cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore the focus remains on that first trade deal which US officials continue to repeat will likely be announced by the end of the week (or Monday at the latest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will want to see if 10% is the floor or we can get lower. Above 10% will likely be taken as a disappointment and should trigger another selloff. Conversely, a rate below 10% (the lower the better) should take us to all-time highs pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that the price broke above the key resistance zone around the 90K level and went into a bit of a consolidation around the 95K level as the market awaits new information on the trade front. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the 90K level to position for a rally into the all-time highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to extend the drop into the 85K level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the price action formed what looks like an expanding rising wedge. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the pullback into the 90K level. Watch out for the FOMC decision today as it could provide a dip-buying opportunity as the market continues to keep a positive outlook for the first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is being reported that the EU would look to propose tariffs on Boeing aircraft as potential retaliation in case trade talks with the US go south. The tariffs will be part of a list of about €100bn of annual US imports to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, that will only be part of the consideration should there be insufficient progress in reducing US tariffs. And the measures above will still have to go through approval from EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The list will be circulated either today or tomorrow but is still subject to change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Gold Sponsor of the highly anticipated #YumiStanap Vanuatu event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This TEDx-inspired conference, which took place on Thursday,
April 24, 2025, at Farea Pacifik, Le Lagon, united a powerhouse lineup of

building resilience, fostering economic development, and unlocking Vanuatu’s
full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major event highlight was the keynote by Marla Dukharan, a

Vanuatu’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels from her work across the Caribbean, she

gender inequality, and climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other distinguished speakers included Hon. Jotham Napat,

Jean-Pierre Nirua, Stephanie Senei Mahuk, and Dr. Jimmy Obed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(L): TMGM Local Director, Johnny Wilson, (R): Prime

in 2024, where the company earned accolades for Best Community Support (First
Runner-up) and Highest Client Numbers in 2024. TMGM&apos;s gold sponsorship of
#YumiStanap further solidifies its growing partnership with the Vanuatu
Financial Services Commission (VFSC). Over the past year, TMGM has worked
closely with VFSC regulators to enhance compliance standards and promote
responsible financial innovation in Vanuatu&apos;s growing digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VFSC has repeatedly acknowledged TMGM&apos;s contributions
through formal commendations. During the event, VFSC representatives
highlighted TMGM as an exemplary model of a regulated entity that balances
innovation with consumer protection, reinforcing the mutual benefits of this
strengthening public-private partnership that continues to attract positive attention
from international financial observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(L): TMGM Local Director, Johnny Wilson and (R):
VFSC Commissioner, Branan KARAE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supporting #YumiStanap is a natural extension of TMGM’s
mission to empower communities and drive sustainable financial innovation,”
said Johnny Wilson, TMGM Vanuatu’s Local Director. “We are deeply invested in
Vanuatu’s journey toward resilience and prosperity; these events are critical
catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference was more than just a discussion; it was a
launchpad for real action. Key issues addressed included economic recovery
strategies, digital innovation, education reforms, and pathways to greater
regional and global integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With media coverage across the Pacific and beyond, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmgm.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;TMGM’s&lt;/a&gt; support ensured that the voices and

      <title>Will the Fed offer a dip-buying opportunity today for the S&amp;P 500?</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;We had a good run in the S&amp;amp;P 500 as the market continued to rally on de-escalation expectations. There&apos;s an old adage saying that &quot;bull markets climb a wall of worry&quot; and that&apos;s exactly what happened in the last weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went pretty quickly from strong pessimism to optimism and the positioning got a bit overstretched. Today, we have the FOMC policy decision and a pushback against the dovish market pricing could trigger some short-term weakness in the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimism for trade deals though will likely trump the negative reaction and keep the uptrend intact. The only thing I can see changing the trend at the moment is a disappointing first trade deal as the market would revise its expectations on the more negative side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a nice support zone around the 5,590 level where we can also find the trendline for confluence. That&apos;s where we can expect the dip-buyers to step in with a defined risk below the trendline to position for a rally into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to extend the pullback into the 5,456 level next. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EURUSD consolidates at a key support zone as we await the next catalyst</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The euro had a great performance year to date mainly due to the increased German fiscal spending expectations and Trump&apos;s tariffs. In the last four weeks though, the EURUSD pair hasn&apos;t done much due to the lack of key developments on the trade and interest rates front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB continues to cut rates amid economic uncertainty and expected slowdown from tariffs. The Fed, on the other hand, is keeping rates steady amid inflation uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short dollar trade is also overstretched, so there&apos;s the risk of some unwinding of the positioning in case the market reprices its dovish expectations for the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we will have the first test as the Fed could push back against the 80 bps of easing priced in by the market giving the greenback a boost. The next key area to watch is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-could-be-dead-wrong-on-rate-cuts-if-this-scenario-plays-out-20250507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;trade negotiations&lt;/a&gt; as positive developments there could see further unwinding of the short dollar trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can see that the EURUSD pair is consolidating at a key support zone around the 1.1278 level where we can also find a trendline for confluence. This is where we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the trendline to position for a rally into the 1.16 handle. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to start targeting the 1.09 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UK April construction PMI 46.6 vs 45.8 expected</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 46.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The downturn in UK construction is seen easing a little, with house building showing some resilience. However, commercial work continues to decline and this time at its quickest pace since May 2020. So, that remains a drag. The overall sector is still in a challenging spot but at least there are some green shoots. S&amp;amp;P Global notes that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;UK construction companies have endured a bumpy
ride since the start of the year as domestic economic
headwinds and hesitancy among clients led to a lack of
new work to replace completed contracts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Output levels continued to slide in April, but the rate of
decline eased to its slowest for three months. This was
helped by slower reductions in residential building work
and civil engineering activity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Commercial construction was a weak spot and lost
momentum since March. Output decreased at the
fastest pace for nearly five years amid reports of greater
risk aversion among clients and a wait-and-see approach
to major spending decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Despite a sharp and accelerated fall in input buying,
strong cost pressures persisted in April. Overall input
price inflation eased only slightly from March&apos;s 26-month
peak. Survey respondents commented on rising prices
paid for a range of raw materials, as well as efforts by
suppliers to pass on greater payroll costs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&quot;An encouraging development in April was a slight
improvement in business activity expectations for the
year ahead. Output growth projections improved to the
highest level so far this year, with a number of survey
respondents citing the prospect of a turnaround in
workloads across the residential building segment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
