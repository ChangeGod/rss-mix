                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The 105,441 job cuts last month is 63% higher compared to the same month last year. That brings the year-to-date total to 602,493 layoffs now, which is the highest since 2020. For some context, the figure is some 87% higher compared to the first four months of 2024. It once again underscores the impact of the DOGE layoffs, with 281,452 of those job cuts being directly attributed to that.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Bessent sounds like he got a good whipping before coming out with his remarks today. But if the idea is to try and convince that there is a plan, the headline remark doesn&apos;t really help to be honest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/the-market-needs-the-answer-to-this-question-what-are-tariffs-for-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;The market needs the answer to this question: What are tariffs for?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need to see de-escalation with China on tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China needs to rebalance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If US, China can rebalance together, that would be a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs situation with China will be a multi step process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chinese economy is slowing down substantially, we will likely revisit Trump&apos;s phase 1 trade deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If holiday orders not placed, could be devastating for China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are going to bring down China&apos;s unfair trade barriers, hold China to its prior commitments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am meeting with Japan on trade today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had very good meetings with Indonesian Finance Minister.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m not involved with EU talks now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are going to bring down European digital services taxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will lessen uncertainty on tariffs every day and every week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategic uncertainty is a Trump negotiating tactic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bolded comment is key for markets and it&apos;s what has been sustaining the stock market rally since April 9 pause. He&apos;s basically telling us that the markets and the economy are indeed important for them despite Trump saying that he doesn&apos;t care as long as he gets what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The near 3% drop today sees oil poised for a potential decline of over 10% this week with not much reprieve in sight. The previous low in April this year touched $55.15 before a bounce on the tariffs pause. But even then, it hardly resulted in a change in confidence in the oil market. In fact, as things went on one can argue that we&apos;re seeing the developments turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The latest news from Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t add much encouragement whatsoever to an already struggling outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the global economic backdrop set to soften amid tariffs and demand conditions also hit hard by the US-China trade standoff, the fact that OPEC+ continues to push for output increases is just adding a heavy burden to oil prices in the current landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;It&apos;s a tough one to weed out and the only saving grace looks to be a turning point on the tariffs front. That will be a key spot to watch for oil, considering it is getting little help elsewhere - in particular from OPEC+ and its members.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A non-consensus trading opportunity as the selloff in crude oil gathers attention</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The crude oil market experienced a rough month due to Trump&apos;s aggressive tariffs announcement on April 2 that made the market to expect lower demand on the slowdown in the global economy coupled with higher supply as OPEC+ planned to increase production by more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw a strong rebound though on April 9 as Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and the market expected more de-escalation and started to price out the global slowdown. The delay in reaching the trade deals and fresh positive supply news eventually weighed on the sentiment and prices rolled over once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, crude oil extended the selloff as we got the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/saudi-officials-have-told-allies-they-can-sustain-a-prolonged-period-of-low-prices-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt; news &lt;/a&gt;that the Saudi officials have told allies that they can sustain a prolonged period of low prices in what sounded like a threat of a price war. The focus is clearly on supply right now, but a non-consensus trade opportunity could be in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ocean container bookings have seen a significant decline since the tariffs announcement with bookings from China to US being down 60%. If Trump eases tariffs, we could experience a covid-like bullwhip effect where all those cancelled orders get rebooked creating a huge surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectations for strong demand and a rebound in global growth will likely push prices higher and a rally to the 70.00 handle on WTI wouldn&apos;t be surprising. But being a contrarian is not enough because you have to get the timing right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Steinhardt, a trading legend, once said that ideally you should be able to tell, in two minutes, four things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the consensus view&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the variant perception&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the trigger event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trigger event, in my opinion, could be the details of the first trade deal. Markets will derive future expectations from that first deal. I think an average tariff rate of 10% or lower (the lower the better), would be the catalyst for a rally in crude oil prices. The idea would be invalidated in case we get a higher rate of course. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump tariffs to have &apos;tremendously adverse&apos; impact on the US economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They &apos;hobble&apos; companies that rely on critical minerals supplies from China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 40% of goods imported into the country were inputs for domestic production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The odds for a recession have gone up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs could be particularly problematic for the US clean energy sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are highly dependent on China for most of the critical minerals that go into the clean energy technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a very consensus view that tariffs will likely have an adverse impact on the US economy and that the recession probabilities have gone up. The market priced that in soon after the April 2 announcement, but started to price out that view after Trump&apos;s pause on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is now looking forward to positive resolutions that will eventually trigger the opposite effect: the US economy will bounce back and economic activity will rise. That&apos;s why trade talks and negotiations are critical. If they disappoint the market, then we will likely go back to price in the recession. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Many individuals and families across the United States face
financial hardship, often struggling to cover essential expenses such as rent,
utilities, childcare, and medical bills. Navigating the complex landscape of
financial assistance programs can be overwhelming, especially for those who are
unsure of where to start or what resources are available to them. This is where
HelpForAfricanAmericans, the largest directory of financial assistance programs
for African Americans, steps in to provide crucial support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HelpForAfricanAmericans operates an extensive database that
compiles information on financial aid opportunities for African Americans in
all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Through its website, users can access a
comprehensive list of programs offering support for various needs, including
help with groceries, rent, utility bills, college expenses, medical bills, and
more. The goal is to connect individuals with the resources that can provide
meaningful assistance during times of financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of the website’s mission is accessibility. By
centralizing information on available financial aid programs, the directory
eliminates much of the guesswork and frustration that often accompanies the
search for assistance. Instead of combing through multiple sources, individuals
can quickly find relevant programs in their state, making it easier to apply
for the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directory covers a wide range of financial aid topics,
ensuring that people can find assistance tailored to their specific
circumstances. Programs listed include grants for home and car repairs, food
assistance, legal aid, childcare support, and help with medical expenses. There
are also resources for those seeking debt consolidation, foreclosure
prevention, and college scholarships. Additionally, specialized programs cater
to individuals with disabilities, seniors, and those facing unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most popular topics among users include rent
assistance, cash aid for those in need, support for purchasing a car or
computer, and help with groceries. These high-demand programs reflect the
common financial challenges faced by many African Americans and highlight the
organization’s commitment to addressing pressing concerns within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual financial assistance, the directory also
provides information on broader government welfare programs and nonprofit
organizations dedicated to supporting African Americans. Users can explore
options such as Section 8 housing assistance, food stamps, and state-specific
grants designed to alleviate financial burdens. The inclusion of these
resources ensures that individuals have a comprehensive understanding of the
aid available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website’s approach is rooted in empowerment. Equipping
people with knowledge about financial assistance programs enables them to make
informed decisions about their financial well-being. The platform also serves
as an educational resource, helping individuals understand eligibility
requirements, application processes, and the scope of available aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a directory of financial
assistance programs, HelpForAfricanAmericans actively works to keep its
information up to date. The landscape of financial aid is constantly evolving,
with new programs being introduced and existing ones undergoing changes.
Maintaining accurate and current information ensures that users can rely on the
directory as a trusted resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking financial relief, finding the right
assistance program can make a significant difference. Whether it’s a grant for
college tuition, support for managing debt, or help covering medical expenses,
https://helpforafricanamericans.org/ simplifies the search process and connects
African Americans with the resources they need. With a commitment to
accessibility, accuracy, and comprehensive coverage, this financial assistance
directory plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between individuals in need
and the support systems designed to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About HelpforAfricanAmericans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Help for African Americans, the mission is to empower
and uplift the African American community by providing accessible resources,
vital information, and support for those in need. The platform works to bridge
gaps in healthcare, education, social justice, and economic opportunity by
fostering a nationwide network of information and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing PMI 45.4 vs 44.0 prelim&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior 44.9&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New orders and employment all decrease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input cost inflation at 28-month high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Dobson, Director at S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The start of the second quarter saw UK manufacturing
buffeted by adverse global market conditions, rising cost
pressures, deteriorating supply chains and increased
trade uncertainty. April saw further contractions in
output, new orders and exports, as well as a slump in
business confidence to its lowest ebb since November
2022.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although domestic demand remains soft, overseas
demand is especially weak. New export business fell
at the quickest pace for nearly five years, with demand
from clients in the US, Europe and mainland China all
declining. Surveyed manufacturers noted that US tariff
announcements were having a noticeable impact on
global markets as trading partners adapt to increased
trade volatility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturers are also seeing an increasingly harsh
cost environment, with purchase price inflation hitting
a 28-month high. Alongside general raw material price
increases on global markets, UK producers are also facing
domestic inflationary pressure from increases to National
Insurance, minimum wages and the knock-on impact of
the latter on higher pay grades. These increased costs
are resulting in a combination of higher selling prices
and cutbacks to non-essential spending on staffing
and purchasing, potentially reinforcing the &apos;rising costs,
declining demand&apos; backdrop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The stock market bottomed a week after the April 2 announcement when President Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9. That week we reached the peak in trade escalation and from that moment onwards, the risk/reward picture favoured the upside for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/this-is-the-key-line-from-chinas-retaliation-you-should-focus-on-20250411/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;de-escalation trend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The negative data continues to be faded because it&apos;s old news and the market is looking forward to positive resolutions and eventually higher economic activity as the trade uncertainty wanes. This trend is likely to remain intact until we get the details of the first trade deal. If the average tariff rate is 10% or lower, we should see the market continuing higher and eventually make new all-time highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a rate above 10% would likely be a disappointment and the market could go back pricing in slower growth with the stock market selling off again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see that the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke above the key resistance level and the major trendline. We got a retest of the broken resistance yesterday when the US GDP triggered some short-term weakness, but eventually we got back to the highs and even made new ones. The next target is the swing level around 5,800 price region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see the short-term selloff triggered by the US GDP that eventually bottomed around the key 5,480 level where the dip buyers piled in and got some support from good US Core PCE data. Later in the day, we also got the news that the US reached to China for tariff talks which supported further upside. And everything culminated with strong tech earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have the 5,596 level as the closest support where the buyers could step in with a defined risk below the level to position for further upside. In case of a break though, the sellers will likely push the price all the way back to the 5,520 level where we will find a minor upward trendline. That will be the next support for the dip-buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 53 bps (55% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBA: 118 bps (92% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RBNZ: 78 bps (75% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 33 bps (81% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 10 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/what-are-the-interest-rate-expectations-for-g8fx-20250428/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest moves in interest rate expectations happened with the Fed and the BoJ. The market increased the easing bets for the Fed following the weaker than expected US Q1 GDP yesterday. and decreased the tightening bets for the BoJ following the dovish policy decision and Governor Ueda&apos;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These expectations hinge on the trade deals though. If the details of the first trade deal show that the average tariff rate will be at or below 10%, then we can expect the market to reprice the expectations on a more hawkish side. Markets tend to overshoot expectations and that&apos;s what provides traders with mean reversion opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The outlook could be less accurate than before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can&apos;t ignore US tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But also should not overemphasise their impact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If US tariffs are zero or at low level, then quicker rate hike could be possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But no need to raise rates hastily when underlying inflation is stalling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For not wanting to put too much emphasis on its impact, he sure talked a lot about tariffs today. USD/JPY currently trades at 144.57 on the day, up from around 144.20 prior to Ueda&apos;s presser.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Technical Analysis – The stagflationary risk continues to be priced out</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Fundamental
Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold continues to correct
lower as the market unwinds some of the stagflationary risk that was priced in
in the past months. The de-escalation trend will likely remain intact until the
first trade deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stagflationary pricing is
what got gold to such high prices, and as we start to price out that risk, it’s
normal to see a correction, especially considering that “long gold” has been
the most crowded trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture, gold
remains in an uptrend as real yields will likely continue to fall amid Fed
easing. But in the short-term more positive news on the tariffs front should see
more downside for gold as the market readjusts to new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can
see that gold broke out of the recent range to the downside as the market
continues to reprice the stagflationary risks. From a risk management
perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the previous
high at 3167 to position for further upside, while the sellers will look for a
break lower to increase the bearish bets into the major trendline around the
3100 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 4 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 4 hour chart, we can
see more clearly the breakout of the range between the 3258 support and the
3367 resistance. We now have a downward trendline defining the bearish
momentum. The sellers will likely step in around the broken support and the
trendline to position for further downside, while the buyers will want to see
the price breaking higher to target the 3367 level next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold Technical Analysis
– 1 hour Timeframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart,
there’s not much else we can add here as the sellers will likely step in both
at the broken support and the trendline, while the buyers will pile in at every
break higher. The red lines define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/&quot;&gt;average daily range&lt;/a&gt; for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming
Catalysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; we get the latest US Jobless Claims
figures and the US ISM Manufacturing PMI. Tomorrow, we conclude the week with
the US NFP report. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Tariffs could negatively impact corporate profits and wage negotiations next year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;But it doesn&apos;t mean we have to wait for all of that to make a policy decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Even when US tariffs are decided, the impact would be hard to read&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This just reinforces his points from earlier, justifying that they have hit the pause button until there is further clarity on how Trump&apos;s tariffs are going to play out.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;This is definitely an interesting comment, especially coming from someone in Ueda&apos;s position. Even if he isn&apos;t in the know, it would be less than prudent to speculate as such though. Or maybe I&apos;m just reading too much into it. But either way, good to keep this in the back of your mind just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the bigger picture, the pair is seeing a neat double-bottom bounce off the 140.00 mark. And the jump higher today sees the pair now move to its highest in three weeks. It&apos;s largely a yen move here as the BOJ left interest rates unchanged, before governor Ueda came out to deliver some less hawkish (more dovish) messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Ueda said that there&apos;s a lot of uncertainty now stemming from US tariffs and how that is impacting the global outlook. He adds that inflation and wage pressures are now expected to cool and that there will be a delay to reaching their 2% price target. On the latter, Ueda says that it is &quot;not simple&quot; anymore to just talk about hitting the inflation target as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Overall, it points to a further pause in the current monetary policy stance. As things stand, that is likely to extend to June at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BOJ governor Ueda: Underlying inflation to cool down due to tariffs, slower global growth</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But would expect underlying inflation to gradually pick up eventually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expect inflation, wage growth to slow down due to tariffs, slower growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outlook is not as certain as it was before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timing of underlying inflation to achieve 2% goal will be somewhat delayed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appropriate to support the economy while maintaining easy monetary environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will guide policy from a standpoint of sustainably, stably achieving price target&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The remarks on slower growth and softer price pressures are aimed to justify the pause today and perhaps in June as well. It&apos;s no doubt a more dovish take. Analysts are largely seeing Q3 as the next point in which the BOJ will hike next. But we&apos;ll have to see how the narrative changes depending on Trump&apos;s tariffs as well in the weeks/months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan&apos;s economy is recovery moderately, although some weakness is still seen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic growth likely to moderate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Economic, price projections could change vastly depending on how countries deal with US tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Must pay due attention to financial, FX markets and impact to Japan&apos;s economy, prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Expected to keep raising rates if economy, prices move in line with projections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The key guidance of expecting to stick with rate hikes if the economic and inflation outlook plays out accordingly is still there, but there&apos;s now dovish elements introduced in the assessment towards the economy at least. It isn&apos;t all too surprising though with Trump tariffs becoming a negative drag towards the global outlook. But in the case of the BOJ, it does dampen the spirits of pushing too hawkishly on hiking rates. From before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/economists-now-more-split-on-next-boj-rate-hike-poll-20250423/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Economists now more split on next BOJ rate hike - poll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session we don&apos;t have much on the agenda given that it&apos;s a holiday in Europe and therefore we should have a quiet session. There&apos;s just the final UK Manufacturing PMI, which is most likely going to be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the US Jobless Claims and the US ISM Manufacturing PMI. As it&apos;s been the case since April 2 (and as you saw yesterday), the market is not focused on the data because it&apos;s old news. The focus is on trade negotiations and the market continues to maintain positive expectations trading into the first trade deal announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISM PMI is expected to be weak given the other regional releases, so it won&apos;t be a surprise. The only data I can see mattering is the US Jobless Claims, but the figure must be at very least above the 260K mark to gather attention. Initial Claims
remain inside the 200K-260K range created since 2022, while Continuing Claims hover
around cycle highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectations are for Initial Claims to come at 224K vs 222K prior, while Continuing Claims are seen at 1864K vs 1841K prior. Other than that, keep an eye on tariff related news as that what matters on a forward looking basis. For now, we are in a de-escalation trend and it will likely remain intact until the first trade deal announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are a couple to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The first ones are for EUR/USD, layered in between 1.1250 through to 1.1330. The expiries don&apos;t tie in to any technical significance but could play a part in limiting price action, especially to the downside in the session ahead. That since the dollar is putting up a stronger showing since overnight trading, with the pair slipping past recent lows around 1.1310-15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Then, there is one for USD/JPY at the 144.00 level. It also isn&apos;t one that ties to any technical significance, so I wouldn&apos;t expect the expiries to factor too much into play for this one. The post-BOJ mood and dollar sentiment remain stronger drivers of price action at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;London markets will be open for trading though but the other major hubs in Europe are all closed in observance of Labor Day. As such, there will be lighter flows in general but that won&apos;t stop an already busy-looking market to start the new month. The dollar is keeping steadier across the board, keeping with overnight gains. But was it all just month-end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;That comes after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-q1-advance-gdp-03-vs-03-expected-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;dismal Q1 advance GDP report&lt;/a&gt;, owing largely to trade, one which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-blames-biden-says-to-be-patient-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Trump is shifting the blame away from&lt;/a&gt;. Equities also staged a neat comeback yesterday, before US futures are seen advancing today after earnings beat from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/meta-eps-643-versus-521-estimate-revenues-4231b-versus-4136b-estimate-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/microsoft-earnings-beat-expectations-20250430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. Tech shares are leading the charge with S&amp;amp;P 500 futures up 0.9% and Nasdaq futures up 1.4% on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Earlier, the BOJ left interest rates unchanged as expected but the yen is down on some minor disappointment. Ueda&apos;s press conference will be up next at 0630 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides that, there&apos;s not much else on the agenda in European trading besides the UK mortgage/credit conditions report for March at 0830 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

The
Bank of Japan kept its short-term interest rate at 0.5%, a widely
exp4ected on hold decision. The BoJ cited growing headwinds from
higher US tariffs. The Bank cut its 2025 and 2026 economic growth
forecasts in its quarterly outlook report. This was a not unexpected
move. A cautious BoJ today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;USD/JPY has risen towards 143.50 with the net dovish statement
and report. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Dialling
back the clock a little to before that focal point for the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;In
late US time United
States trade representative Greer
admitted
that
there are no official talks with China on trade, He
said also that ‘initial’ trade deals with some other countries
are still weeks away. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Australia
published March trade data, showing a widening surplus on a surge in
exports, up 7.6% m/m on gold (26% rise in non-monetary gold
shipments) and other commodity shipments. Iron ore exports recovered
from weather disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Exports
to the US jumped. Australia runs a trade deficit with the US but in
March recorded a surplus ahead of tariffs. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imports
dropped by 2.2% m/m, capital goods showing a notable drop. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Also
from Australia today were export and import price indexes. Consumer
goods import prices rose, which may impact inflation ahead if such
rises continue. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Of
note for those with an interest in equities, the Wall Street Journal
reported that Tesla’s board has begun discussions with search firms
to explore potential successors to CEO Elon Musk. In the reports the
Journal noted that Some directors, including Tesla co-founder JB
Straubel, have been meeting with major investors to reassure them the
company is in good hands. This will be in reference to the damage
Musk has inflicted on the brand through his political and ideological
activities. Data from France released today gave some insight into
this. While new
car registrations in France fell 5.64% in April from a year earlier
the figure for Tesla was an order of magnitude worse, Tesla sales
fell 59.45%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;US
equity indexes rose in ‘overnight’ Globex trade, adding to their
solid bounce during Wednesday RTH trade.
