                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mon: US Holiday (Memorial Day), UK Holiday (Bank Holiday)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tue: NBH Policy Announcement; German GfK (Jun), French Prelim. CPI (May), EZ Consumer Confidence (May), US Durable Goods (Apr), Dallas Fed (May)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wed: RBNZ Policy Announcement, FOMC Minutes (May), Riksbank Financial Stability Report, OPEC JMMC; Australian CPI (Apr), German Unemployment (May), US MBA (w/e 19th May), Richmond Fed (May), Nvidia (NVDA) earnings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thu: Swiss &amp;amp; Scandinavian Holiday (Ascension Day), BoK &amp;amp; SARB Policy Announcements; US GDP 2nd (Q1), PCE (Q1), Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 24th May), Pending Home Sales (Apr)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fri: CBRT Financial Stability Report; Japanese Tokyo CPI (May), German Import Prices (Apr), CPI Prelim. (May), EZ M3 (Apr), US PCE (Apr), Personal Income/Consumption (Apr), Chicago PMI (May), Canadian GDP (Q1)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Earnings Preview (Wed): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, 28th May, at 21:20BST/16:20EDT, and while obvious attention will be on the quarterly figures and guidance, participants will be cognizant of what is said about China-US relations and chip bans. In recent remarks, and since China/ US agreed to lower tariffs on each other, CEO Huang warned of &quot;tremendous loss&quot; as export controls limit US access to China&apos;s market. In separate comments, Huang said the US tightening of chip export controls has a significant impact on Cos. business, and it will resolutely provide services to the Chinese market. Numerically, Huang expects USD 5.5bln in charges in Q1 FY26 related to H20 products as the US informed the co. it requires a licence to export to China. Ahead of the metrics, KeyBanc expects the tech-behemoth to report a more modest upside to Q1 results and Q2 (July) guidance due to the headwinds associated with the AI China chip ban and continued supply constraints associated with GB200 NVL72. However, KeyBanc does believe that Nvidia plans to ramp up another China-compliant GPU that does not use HBM, which should partially offset the impact of this ban. NVDA is still targeting 30k GB200 racks for the year, but KeyBanc is increasingly worried about the ability to achieve this. As a result, KeyBanc is fine-tuning its near-term estimates, which previously had already reflected the impact of the AI China ban and is trimming its H2 ’26 estimates to reflect continued supply constraints related to GB200 production. Looking at the expectations, Q1 EPS is expected at USD 0.92 with revenue printing at USD 43.09bln. Looking at the breakdown, Data Centre is seen at USD 39.07bln, Gaming 2.82bln, Automotive 595mln, Professional Visualization 505mln, and OEM and other 120mln. Regarding some other key metrics, the gross profit margin is expected at 71% and operating expense at 3.6bln. In terms of forward guidance, the next quarter&apos;s (Q2) revenue is seen at USD 46.59bln, with EPS of USD 1.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBNZ Announcement (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBNZ is expected to lower rates for the sixth consecutive meeting next week with money markets pricing in a 91% probability that the central bank will cut the OCR by 25bps to 3.25% and with just a 9% chance for rates to be kept unchanged at the current level. As a reminder, the RBNZ lowered the OCR by 25bps to 3.50% at the last meeting in April, as unanimously forecast and which the central bank had pre-signalled, while it noted at that meeting that a further reduction in the OCR is appropriate and as the extent of tariffs becomes clearer, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further. RBNZ also stated that global trade barriers weakened the outlook for global growth and that having CPI close to the middle of the target band puts the committee in the best position to respond to developments. Furthermore, the minutes from the meeting stated that future policy decisions will be determined by the outlook for inflationary pressure over the medium term. It stated that the monetary policy response to tariffs will focus on the medium-term implications for inflation but added that the implications of increased tariffs for global and domestic inflation are more ambiguous. The rhetoric from officials since then has continued to highlight trade and tariff-related uncertainty as RBNZ Governor Hawkesby noted that the threat of a trade war has decreased recently but there is still considerable uncertainty about how things will play out and that supply-side impacts from tariffs could impact New Zealand significantly. RBNZ Chief Economist Conway also commented that higher tariffs and uncertainty about global trade policy mean economic activity globally and in New Zealand will most likely be weaker than expected and that the balance of risks had shifted to the downside. As such, the central bank is expected to continue with its current rate-cutting cycle to support the economy amid the ongoing global trade uncertainty, while the recent key data releases since the last meeting have been mixed and therefore are unlikely to derail the central bank from its current path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOMC Minutes (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FOMC left rates unchanged at 4.25–4.50%, as expected, with a unanimous vote. The statement noted that uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased further and added that “risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen”. The Fed repeated its March language that economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace, though net export swings have affected the data. It maintained its view that inflation remains somewhat elevated and labour market conditions are solid, with the unemployment rate stabilising at a low level. The key changes centred on increased uncertainty and the risks on both sides of the dual mandate. In his press conference, Chair Powell reiterated that the Fed is well-positioned to respond as needed and remains in a “wait-and-see” stance. On tariffs, he noted they have been larger than anticipated but have yet to show major effects in the data, though concerns remain. Powell said the Fed will adjust policy as the economy evolves, balancing dual mandate goals by assessing how far and how fast each side may drift from target. He declined to specify which side is at greater risk and stressed the Fed is in no rush but can act quickly if necessary. Note, the minutes of the meeting are an account of information that was available to them at the time of the meeting on 7th May 2025, therefore it will not incorporate the recent de-escalation on trade with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC JMMC (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC+ will convene its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) on Wednesday ahead of the full ministerial meeting on June 1st, with delegates reportedly discussing the prospect of a third consecutive output hike, according to Bloomberg sources. Sources suggest a potential 411k BPD increase for July is under consideration — three times the originally scheduled monthly hike — although no final decision has yet been reached. The move would maintain Saudi’s recent strategy of accelerating supply additions in an effort to enforce discipline on members exceeding quotas. At the last meeting, Saudi Arabia issued a firm warning to overproducing nations, threatening further output increases unless compliance improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian CPI (Wed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets expected the monthly CPI indicator at 2.3% Y/Y (prev. 2.4%). Westpac is forecasting a 0.3% rise in the April Monthly CPI Indicator - which will take the annual pace down to 1.9%. Australia’s CPI data will be closely watched following the RBA’s expected 25bps rate cut earlier in May, which brought the Cash Rate to 3.85%. The RBA noted that while inflation is moderating, the outlook remains uncertain, with the risks to inflation now seen as more balanced. The cut was accompanied by a downgrade in global growth forecasts and trimmed domestic core inflation projections in the central bank’s quarterly update. The Q1 CPI print showed headline inflation at 2.4% Y/Y, steady from the prior quarter, while core inflation fell into the RBA’s 2–3% target band for the first time since 2021, at 2.9% Y/Y. However, price pressures remain in non-discretionary items like electricity, food, health, and education, which drove a 0.7% Q/Q rise in core CPI. A softer April print would validate the RBA’s dovish tilt, supporting expectations for two more rate cuts in H2 2025, as per market pricing. Conversely, stickier inflation in key components could complicate the easing path. At the May meeting presser, Governor Bullock revealed that the board discussed cutting by 25bps or 50bps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BoK Announcement (Thu):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Korea will conduct a policy meeting next week to decide whether to maintain rates at the current level of 2.75% or resume its rate-cutting cycle following the surprise contraction in South Korea’s economy during Q1. As a reminder, the BoK kept its base rate unchanged at the last meeting in April, as expected, with the rate decision not unanimous as board member Shin Sung-Hwan dissented and saw a need to respond to the worsening economic outlook. BoK noted that uncertainties to the growth path were higher and headwinds to economic growth were seen to be bigger than previously expected, while it will determine the timing and pace of any further base rate cuts and stated the monetary easing policy stance is to continue. BoK Governor Rhee revealed that most board members saw lower interest rates in the three months ahead and that they will factor in the interest rate differential with the US for the next rate decision, as well as assess in May whether the policy rate needs to go below 2.25% by year-end. Furthermore, Rhee acknowledged that first-quarter growth is likely to be significantly lower, partly due to the recent domestic political crisis, and they couldn’t rule out the possibility of the economy contracting in Q1 with the uncertainties to the growth path higher and headwinds to economic growth were seen to be bigger than previously expected. As such, the contraction in the economy materialised with Advanced GDP for Q1 QQ at -0.2% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. 0.1%) and YY at -0.1% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. 1.2%), which supports the case for the central bank to resume its easing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo CPI (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no consensus for the Tokyo CPI release, which is seen as a leading indicator to the National CPI typically released a couple of weeks later - the data will be closely watched as a leading signal for national price trends. ING expects inflationary pressures to remain broad-based, with core CPI likely rising slightly amid steady headline inflation. The data comes at a delicate time for the BoJ, which faces mounting policy complexity due to sticky inflation and weakening industrial output, the latter pressured by recent US auto tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US PCE (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April’s CPI and PPI data suggest core PCE inflation softened in April. Core CPI rose +0.2% M/M, below expectations for +0.3%, while core PPI unexpectedly fell 0.4% M/M. Together, they imply the core PCE deflator increased by just 0.12% M/M (prev. 0.0%), according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, bringing the annual rate down to 2.5% Y/Y from 2.6%. For the headline rate, Fed Chair Powell has predicted that April PCE was likely around 2.2% Y/Y (vs 2.3% in March), albeit this did not incorporate the latest PPI report. The deceleration in Core PCE largely reflects sharp PPI drops in portfolio management prices, which is heavily weighted in the PCE calculation. Looking ahead, core PCE inflation is still expected to peak between 3.0% and 3.5% later this year, Pantheon writes, assuming current tariffs persist. It says that while tariffs may add around 1ppts to goods prices, this is likely to be offset by easing services inflation, driven by softer rental and labour cost pressures. As the inflationary impact of tariffs appears contained and profit margins absorb some cost increases, markets expect the Fed to cut rates by 50bps this year. Fed officials have been cautious on giving any outlook updates amid the uncertainty, but the influential Governor Waller has argued again that he does not see much from tariffs to suggest that inflation will rise persistently, again noting that the Fed can look through one-time effects; this view was also echoed by others recently, including the Fed&apos;s Vice Chair Jefferson, and Musalem, while some -- Like Fed&apos;s Bostic -- suggest that inflation expectations are troubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada GDP (Fri):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canada&apos;s March 2025 and Q1 2025 GDP will be released on Friday. The March data will likely start to show the immediate effect of tariffs on the Canadian economy, given tariffs on Canada came before Liberation Day, a 10% tariff on Energy and Potash, and a 25% tariff on Steel and Aluminium. US President Trump also implemented a 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant goods, but the actual imposition was not implemented until April (outside of Q1). Nonetheless, given Canada was subject to certain tariffs in March, and the announcement was expected - an impact will likely start to be seen in the data. The data will likely help shape expectations for the June BoC meeting. Recent inflation data was hotter than expected, and money markets have started to price a 25bps rate cut in June with less certainty. Initially, the hot inflation data saw pricing ease from a 60% probability of a 25bps rate cut to a 50% probability, with now just a 30% probability of a 25bps rate cut at the next meeting. A slowdown in the economy could bolster the case for another 25bps rate cut, which would take the BoC rate below the 2.75% midpoint of the BoC&apos;s neutral rate estimate (2.25-3.25%). The BoC paused in April and continued to provide no guidance due to the uncertainties ahead. However, Governor Macklem did note they are prepared to act decisively if incoming information points clearly in one direction. It is also worth noting that the Minutes of the meeting found that the council was split on whether to cut or hold. Those who favoured a cut, cited near-term inflation risks and signs that the economy was weakening. A sign of a further slowdown for the upcoming GDP data would likely bolster the case for a cut at the upcoming meeting, although the hot inflation may see others prefer to hold once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsquawk.com/daily/article/?id=4589-week-ahead-highlights-include-nvidia-earnings-fomc-minutes-us-pce-rbnz-australia-cpi-and-opec-jmmc-&amp;amp;utm_source=forexlive&amp;amp;utm_medium=research&amp;amp;utm_campaign=partner-post&amp;amp;utm_content=week-ahead&quot;&gt;Newsquawk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In a follow-up post, he proposed a flat 50% tariff on the European Union, set to begin June 1. Later in the day, he reaffirmed his position, stating, “I’m not looking for a deal with the EU. It’s set at 50%.” The message is clear—Trump remains steadfast on tariffs, whether targeting foreign nations or U.S.-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;1186&quot;&gt;If the EU retaliates, additional escalation could be on the horizon.

Austan Goolsbee, speaking on CNBC, emphasized that businesses are seeking consistency in policy amidst the uncertainty created by rapidly changing tariffs—particularly pointing to the proposed 50% EU tariff as a disruptive and alarming development for supply chains. He noted growing anxiety among firms about inflationary pressures stemming from ongoing tariff announcements and warned that such moves could have stagflationary consequences—the worst-case scenario for a central bank. Goolsbee stressed the importance of waiting for clearer data before acting, acknowledging that the effects of current policies may already be in motion but not yet visible in economic reports. While he still believes the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong, he indicated that his previous forecast for rate cuts by year-end may now be delayed by up to 16 months due to heightened uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Louis Fed Pres.Musalem warned that the Fed is closely monitoring signs that short-term inflation expectations could seep into long-term outlooks, a dynamic they are keen to avoid. He noted that businesses are already expecting higher input and output prices and are struggling to manage growing uncertainty. While GDP is currently close to its potential, inflation remains above target. Musalem also emphasized that the current environment is markedly different from the pandemic era, adding that the probability of a near-term Fed rate cut is low—estimated at just one in five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, Kansas City Federal Reserve Pres. Jeffrey Schmid emphasized that current uncertainty is largely being driven by ongoing tariff discussions. He stated that the Fed will place greater weight on hard data rather than forecasts when making interest rate decisions, cautioning against overreliance on soft data. Schmid also highlighted the need for the Fed to carefully consider its future use of the balance sheet. He acknowledged that markets have already priced in 83 basis points of rate cuts over the coming year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed - like businesses - are struggling with the uncertainty from the Trump administration and their policy actions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar would lower versus all the major currency pairs with the biggest mover being against the NZD /1.44%) and the AUDUSD (-1.31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback also fell close to 1% versus the JPY (-1.0%), CHF (-0.93%), and the CAD (-0.93%).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading week, the dollar was weaker vs all the major currencies as well::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EUR: -1.81%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JPY, -2.13%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GBP, -1.99%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHF -1.93%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAD -1.69%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AUD, -1.47%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NZD, -1.82%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil fell modestly this week by -0.29%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold rose by 4.82% with its largest weekly gain since April 7 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin rose from $106,520 to $108,234&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t sound like the US and EU make a quick deal on trade that will drop the 50% tariffs that Trump recommended today and to go into effect on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US is fully engaged and committed to securing a deal that works for both &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU commission remains ready to work in good faith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough to tell which way this is going to go but at least Sefcovic didn&apos;t go full-China style and announce immediate retaliatory tariffs -- though there&apos;s an argument that&apos;s the optimal strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;US President Trump appears to have green-lighted the Nippon Steel takeover of US Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a deal that he opposed on the campaign trail and was killed by President Biden after the election. However Nippon and US Steel sued to keep the deal alive and more-recently sweetened the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rejection of the deal was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/rejecting-the-us-steel-sale-to-nippon-steel-will-mark-the-end-of-an-era-in-us-capitalism-20241230/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;a low point for American capitalism &lt;/a&gt;and went against the idea that foreign companies should invest in the United States if they wanted to avoid tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump wrote on Truth Social that was a &apos;planned partnership&apos; and that sparked some confusion but it looks like this is just spin as the $14 billion investment is exactly what Nippon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/nippon-steel-invest-14-billion-us-steel-including-4-billion-new-mill-document-2025-05-19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dangled &lt;/a&gt;to close the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares jumped 23% and are close to the deal price of $55/share. If approved the deal could close as soon as this weekend as both Nippon and US Steel have been ready to close for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud to announce that, after much consideration and negotiation, 
US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great 
City of Pittsburgh. For many years, the name, “United States Steel” was 
synonymous with Greatness, and now, it will be again. This will be a 
planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which 
will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the 
U.S. Economy. The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 
months. This is the largest Investment in the History of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. My Tariff Policies will ensure that Steel 
will once again be, forever, MADE IN AMERICA. From Pennsylvania to 
Arkansas, and from Minnesota to Indiana, AMERICAN MADE is BACK. I will 
see you all at US Steel, in Pittsburgh, on Friday, May 30th, for a BIG 
Rally. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite how this whole sad saga unfolded, it ultimately ends up in the good place for the US as Nippon will modernize a portion of the US steel industry and force it into a more-competitive place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loser in this is Cleveland-Cliffs who lobbied hard to keep out foreign competition and investment. Shares of CLF are down 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil is settling the day up $0.33 on the day at $61.53. The high today reached $61.84. The low was at $60.06.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading week, the price is closing down marginally by about - $0.34 or -0.54%. The high for the week was at $64.14. The low was at $60.06.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline this week was the first in 3 weeks as expectations of another OPEC+ production increase and concerns and uncertainty about growth given the tariffs environment weighs on price as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price action this week was above and below the 100/200 hour MA (blue and green lines). Those MAs come in near $61.66 (converged).  The price is closing below those MAs tilting the bias more to the downside at the end of the week. However, the MAs will be the barometer for buyers and sellers next week. Trade above is more bullish. Trade below is more bearish. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could talk about delays to EU tariffs if they start moving to the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks with EU are slow moving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m not looking for a deal, it&apos;s set at 50%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numerous other deals ready to be signed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would also tariff Samsung and others who make iPhones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook said he would go to India but there would still be tariffs that way&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has slowed the rebound in stocks. Obviously, he is looking for a deal with the EU but this is how he talks. Then again, who knows with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;92&quot; data-end=&quot;419&quot;&gt;Credit Agricole sees the return of the &quot;USD frown&quot;—the relationship between USD and US equity/FI performance—driving near-term USD weakness. But they dismiss fears of a full-blown crisis akin to the UK’s &quot;Truss moment,&quot; citing continued global demand for Treasuries and the USD’s reserve status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;421&quot; data-end=&quot;436&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;438&quot; data-end=&quot;1403&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;438&quot; data-end=&quot;656&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;440&quot; data-end=&quot;656&quot;&gt;USD Selling on Risk Aversion:Investors are selling USD as US equities weaken and Treasury yields rise, fearing capital outflows and fragility in US fixed income following Moody’s sovereign downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;658&quot; data-end=&quot;893&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;660&quot; data-end=&quot;893&quot;&gt;Political and Policy Concerns:Stalled fiscal stimulus talks in Congress and Fed commentary on stagflation risks have amplified worries over the macro backdrop and reinforced the USD’s vulnerability to risk sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;895&quot; data-end=&quot;1157&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;897&quot; data-end=&quot;1157&quot;&gt;But No &apos;Truss Moment&apos;:Credit Agricole does not expect a disorderly selloff in US debt akin to the UK gilt crisis under PM Liz Truss.

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;140&quot; data-end=&quot;422&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is pushing higher today, extending above Wednesday’s high of 0.6469 and reaching a session peak of 0.6494. The pair is up 1.26% on the day, with an 87-pip trading range, well above the 22-day average of 72 pips—highlighting strong momentum in favor of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;424&quot; data-end=&quot;718&quot;&gt;Technically, the rally began in the early Asian session as the pair found support at an upward-sloping trendline. That bounce encouraged buyers, and the bullish tone strengthened once price broke above the converged 100- and 200-hour moving averages (blue and green lines on the chart near 0.6434).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;720&quot; data-end=&quot;968&quot;&gt;A brief dip in the early U.S. session followed Trump-related headlines that sent equities lower, but importantly, the pullback stalled right at those same hourly MAs (again near 0.6434), reaffirming them as support and setting the stage for another upward leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;970&quot; data-end=&quot;1002&quot;&gt;The latest move has seen AUDUSD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1058&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1005&quot; data-end=&quot;1058&quot;&gt;Break above the 200-day moving average at 0.64526&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1061&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot;&gt;Push through a downward-sloping topside trendline near 0.64827&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;Test resistance near recent swing highs (May 5 and May 14) around 0.6494–0.65005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1216&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot;&gt;A break above those swing highs would target:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1324&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1264&quot; data-end=&quot;1324&quot;&gt;2025 high at 0.65135, the highest level since December 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1325&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1327&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;61.8% retracement of the 2024 high–low move at 0.65489 (on the daily chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1408&quot; data-end=&quot;1624&quot;&gt;Conclusion:
Buyers remain firmly in control. Holding above the 100/200-hour MAs and 200-day MA keeps the bullish momentum intact. A break of 0.6500/0.6514 opens the door to broader upside targets toward 0.6549.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) MARKETS NO LONGER TAKE TARIFF THREATS AT FACE VALUE: VANGUARD

Bond markets&apos; initial reaction to Trump&apos;s new tariff threats was to sell off Treasurys, pushing yields up from early lows, but it didn&apos;t go too far. Apparently, investors expect the steep 50% tariff proposal on imports from the E.U. to be negotiated down, similarly to what happened with China. &quot;The market has kind of slowed down now because it&apos;s happened before, and we know what happened before,&quot; Vanguard&apos;s John Madziyire says. &quot;It&apos;s kind of like the boy who cried wolf,&quot; he says. &quot;The administration is not crazy, they have a plan and there is a limit,&quot; to how far they will go, he says. The 10-year Treasury yields is at 4.503%</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD moved lower on the back of the post from Pres.Trump at the start of the US session that he was proposing a 50% tariff on EU imports.  Later the administration started to walk that idea back as it &quot;just a suggestion&quot; (i.e. part of the art of the deal).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price moved down to test the rising 100-hour MA on the headlines,  and got within 5-6 pips of the MA level. Buyers leaned and the dip as risk could be defined and limited against the level  The backtracking led to more buying as London/European traders exited for the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price has now moved back toward the highs from Wednesday at 1.1362.  Above that is a 61% retracement of the move down from the April high. That little comes in a 1.1378. The high prices from May 6 and May 7 also stalled near that retracement level increasing its importance (see green numbered circles).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;More from Treasury Secretary Bessent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;US Sovereign Wealth Fund is on pause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may be wrong but the idea stemmed from the receipts from the External Revenue Service and perhaps from the savings from DOGE.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN reality, if tariffs are too high, they won&apos;t provide any revenue as they become embargos instead.  Moreover, if the shakedown is to manufacture ALL goods in the US, that does not help tariff collections dreamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOGE fell well short of savings expected. There will be no windfall there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drill baby drill?  Baker Hughes rig counts continue to move lower as the cost is too high and oil companies are shiifting to returning capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess there may be deals with China down the road.on commodities from farmers, but those types of promises are often broken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has also touted a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. He met with the largest holders of his personal digital coin. We will probably hearing more above this type of fund as it becomes the idea du jour.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expect we will be negotiating with China in person again&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a Laffer Curve for tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of these non-tariff barriers are coming down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don&apos;t know where &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees &apos;several hundred billion&apos; per year in tariff revenue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;my sense is that int he next several weeks we will have several large deals announced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeats that the EU has a collective-action problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The German finance minister was very responsive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Merz will provide an opportunity for a US-German reset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All yields are up since the start of the year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market could also be thinking the Congressional yield could create growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he&apos;s not concerned about USD weakening alongside higher yields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other currencies are strengthening, rather than USD weakening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much to get excited about here. If anything, the comments about a US-Germany reset are positive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USD/CAD flirts with the lowest since October</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;I have a close eye on USD/CAD today  as the pair steadily slides as part of the broader US dollar selloff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loonie is so far underperforming the AUD and NZD today in percentage terms but it&apos;s also brushing up against an important level. Moreover, the market may be hesitant to push though with US and UK holidays coming on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key item on the agenda for the loonie in the week ahead is Thursday&apos;s Canadian GDP report. RBC expects it will show the Canadian economy grew by 1.8% annualized
in Q1. The caveat is that the quarter was front-loaded with strength in January that gradually faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect to see an increase in household consumption
in Q1 that was partially offset by a contraction in residential investment as
home resales cooled. Business investment likely inched higher, but is expected
to soften in the coming quarters as businesses freeze spending plans amid
disruptive trade policies,&quot; RBC writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My major worry about Canada relates to housing, which continues to crack. Listings are mounting quickly in the Toronto area and with 5-year rates rising, there is little hope for relief any time soon. The Bank of Canada is now less-likely to cut rates in June and the rising loonie will help to cool inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NZDUSD is stretching to new highs for the day and also new highs for the week (highest level since May 8). That move has taken the price above the 0.59664 from Wednesday, which also was near the high price going back to last week on May 14. Getting above that level is a bullish play and opens the door for further upside momentum for the NZDUSD..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increased momentum, we could see the price ultimately reach the high prices from both April and May. Those levels came between 0.6018 and 0.6028 over time (see red numbered circles on the chart below). Getting above those levels would take the pair to the highest level since November 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves to the upside, come after sellers had their shot over the last 8 or so days on breaks of the 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart.  However, each time the price tried to extend below the 200 bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, sellers turned back to buyers fairly quickly (see green numbered circles outlining the tests of that 200 bar moving average).  That ultimately was the dominant play technically, that has moved the price higher this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video above, outlines the key levels in play and explains why.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today’s stock market reveals a challenging environment for technology stocks, with mixed outcomes across financial and healthcare sectors. Investors witness a dynamic trading landscape, highlighting the need for keen strategy and portfolio management. 🏛️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📉 Tech Sector: Widespread Declines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The technology sector is leading today’s downturn, with Microsoft (MSFT) experiencing a drop of 0.73% and Oracle (ORCL) down by 0.98%. Nvidia (NVDA), a major player in semiconductors, fell by 1.63%, continuing a challenging trend for chip manufacturers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sector-wide decline highlights current investor hesitation amid industry-specific pressures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;📈 Financial and Healthcare Sectors: Mixed Reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The financial sector shows resilience, despite a slight pullback in Visa (V) by 1.18% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 0.66%. Interestingly, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) shows strength with a 0.99% gain, indicating potential confidence in select financial services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The healthcare sector reflects steady performance with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) up by 0.14%, signaling modest investor interest in defensive stocks during market volatility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚀 Consumer &amp; Communications: Mixed Signals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon (AMZN) dropped by 0.94%, while Meta (META) fell 1.25%, contrasting with a better-than-expected performance in consumer cyclical sectors, indicating a cautious consumer sentiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) also experienced declines, hinting at investor wariness regarding future growth amid economic uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;📚 Market Mood and Strategies Forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, driven by adverse news in technology and muted recovery signals in other sectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investors are advised to maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks associated with specific sector declines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider keeping an eye on the financial sector&apos;s potential for stability and exploring opportunities within healthcare stocks as safe havens in turbulent times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay informed and adjust your strategies as needed by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for comprehensive market analysis and news.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;USD/CAD is flirting with a break of the lows of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar is sliding broadly today but the Canadian dollar is getting an extra lift from March and April retail sales data. The numbers were solid and come on the heels of a hotter CPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, that has the odds of a June 4 rate cut down to 28% from 65% before CPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists at CIBC were one group calling for cuts and now sound like they&apos;re just waiting for next week&apos;s GDP report to flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our forecast for a contraction in GDP in April and Q2 as a whole is driven more by expected
weakness in manufacturing and other sectors more directly impacted by US trade. Advance figures for those areas are
due to be released early next week, but if they also aren&apos;t as weak as anticipated then we will have to revise our forecast
for monthly GDP and likely our Bank of Canada rate cut call as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the report itself, they note that consumer spending has been holding up better than anticipated. The caveat is that auto sales were a big driver of stronger retail sales and that could have been a tariff front-run trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch for stops below the May low of 1.3748.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;The USDCAD remains under selling pressure after failing to sustain gains above key resistance near 1.4009–1.4026 and the 200-day MA last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;This week, the price on Wednesday fell below a swing area between 1.38917 to 1.3904.  The break and hold below this zone gave sellers the green light to drive the pair even lower and they did on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the price corrected back toward the swing area again, with the high price reaching 1.3888 just short of the low of the swing area at 1.38917.  Sellers still in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;Today, the momentum lower continued with the pair now looking to test the lows of 2025 (and lowest levels since October 2024).  That level comes between 1.37497 to 1.37698 (see red numbered circles).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;698&quot; data-end=&quot;829&quot;&gt;Do the buyers stall the fall at the lows for 2025?  Traders looking to buy a dip can lean with a stop below.  However, be aware that the 61.8% of the move up from the 2023 low comes in at 1.37415 - just below the low from 2025. So it might be wise for dip buyers to wait on a break of that retracement level.   &lt;/p&gt;

Shares of home builders have struggled badly this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a surprising number but it looks like some sales have simply been shifted by a month as the March number was revised far lower.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think there is any secret on what&apos;s happening between the US and EU at the moment; Bessent spelled it out. He said the EU has been moving too slowly on trade and Trump wants to &apos;light a fire&apos; under the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was strategically timed ahead of a call today that was scheduled previously. At 12:30 pm ET, there is a call scheduled between EU trade boss Sefcovic and USA counterpart Greer will take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will be waiting for a read-out (or leak) from that call afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: One report says this call is at 11 am ET, so watch out for headlines earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;75&quot; data-end=&quot;348&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to trade with a bearish tilt after a series of failed upside attempts near key technical levels. The 100-hour moving average (currently near 0.8284) served as strong resistance earlier this week, capping rallies yesterday most recently, and helping to turn buyers into sellers into the day close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;350&quot; data-end=&quot;682&quot;&gt;The recent decline seen today, initially found buyers near the 50% midpoint of the April-to-May range at 0.8257. However, EU tariff news triggered a decisive break below this level, adding downside momentum. The pair did not find support until reaching the next key swing area between 0.8193 and 0.8212—highlighted by past price reaction zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;With price now below both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages and under key Fibonacci retracement levels, the bears remain in control unless buyers can push the pair back above 0.8257 (50%) and then 0.8284 (100 hour MA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;Overall, howver, the technicals are doing their job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;888&quot; data-end=&quot;913&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;916&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8257 (50% retracement), 0.8284 (100-hour MA), 0.8300 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;999&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8212/0.8193 (swing area), 0.8163, 0.8139&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1051&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1053&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.8284, with further downside potential if 0.8193 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
