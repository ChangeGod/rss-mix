      <title>(My Local Feed) $TSLA - MORGAN STANLEY: TESLA’S AUTONOMY PUSH DRIVEN BY RISING CHINA EV THREAT

Morgan Stanley says Tesla’s focus on autonomy is a response to growing competition from Chinese EV makers like Xiaomi, whose new YU7 could match the success of last year’s SU7. The firm believes China may have already won the EV race and warns that U.S. tariffs won’t keep Chinese EVs out of the market.

Tesla’s shift to autonomy reflects the increasing pressure from China’s rapid EV growth, which the firm says is underappreciated by the market. Morgan Stanley maintains an Overweight rating and $410 price target on Tesla.</title>

The only highlight was the RBA policy decision where the central bank cut interest rates by 25 bps as expected and lowered growth and inflation forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AUD fell initially on the dovish forecasts but eventually bounced back. The Aussie dollar couldn&apos;t sustain the pressure though after RBA&apos;s Governor Bullock mentioned that they debated between a 25 and 50 bps cut. That sent the AUD to new lows and the market increased the easing expectations for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, we got some ECB speakers that are now starting to change their tone around the need for further cuts. The hawks are particularly wary of overdoing it on rate cuts and not reach their inflation target on a sustained basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the Canadian CPI 
report where the Trimmed Mean Y/Y is expected at 2.9% vs. 2.8% prior and
 the Median Y/Y is seen at 2.9% vs. 2.9% prior. The market is pricing a 
62% chance of a 25 bps cut at the upcoming meeting and a total of 47 bps
 of easing by year-end. A higher than expected reading could see the 
market price out a rate cut at the upcoming meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
 will also have some more Fedspeak and the focus will be on potential 
hawkish comments as the market is now back at pricing just two rate cuts
 in 2025. From now on, we will either price in more cuts or less cuts 
than expected and that will move markets.&lt;/p&gt;

We got some rate cuts recently and that certainly gives some support to the economy, but I would like them to go bigger on rate cuts given that they still have positive real rates amid deflationary forces.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(My Local Feed) WELLS FARGO: BUY U.S. STOCKS, AVOID EMERGING MARKETS

Wells Fargo advises investors to reduce emerging market (EM) stock holdings, despite recent gains, citing weak long-term performance and structural risks like political instability and China’s economic issues.

The firm sees U.S. and developed market equities as more stable alternatives and recommends reallocating to U.S. large- and mid-cap stocks. For risk reduction, it suggests commodities or select fixed-income assets.</title>

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed: 54 bps (91% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB: 52 bps (93% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoE: 45 bps (84% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoC: 47 bps (64% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)

    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SNB: 47 bps (81% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;*for the SNB, the rest of the probability is for a 50 bps cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate hikes by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BoJ: 17 bps (98% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing remained roughly unchanged for most central banks except the RBA where we saw a more dovish repricing after Governor Bullock&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/rba-governor-bullock-did-discuss-25-bps-or-50-bps-cut-20250520/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;50 bps comment&lt;/a&gt; today (it was 57 bps before that comment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now at a point where the market got back to previous expectations and from now on we will need stronger reasons to price out the rate cuts. That will obviously move the markets. Of course the same is true for pricing in more rate cuts than currently expected.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mid-term inflation outlook too uncertain to say whether we need a June cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB projections likely to show lower inflation this year and the next, but longer term is uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally think the ECB shouldn&apos;t cut in June and pause now to see how things evolve. There&apos;s a scenario where they might have already over-eased and could struggle to bring inflation sustainably back to target.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don&apos;t think nuclear talks with the US will be successful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;US demand that Iran stops enrichment is outrageous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US should avoid talking nonsense in talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This headline gave crude oil prices a boost as the markets continue to bounce around amid the US-Iran nuclear deal. A positive resolution is seen as bearish (at least in the near term) due to higher supply expectations. Conversely, negative outcomes are seen as bullish.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vote against interest rate cut was a &apos;skip&apos; within a continuing withdrawal of monetary policy restriction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation pressure indicators give me cause for concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quarterly pace of 25 bps cuts seen since last summer is too rapid given the inflation outlook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My dissenting vote was favouring a &apos;skip&apos; in the quarterly pattern of bank rate cuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It should not be seen as favouring a halt to withdrawal of restriction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structural changes in price and wage setting behaviour have increased the intrinsic persistence of the UK inflation process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pace of quarterly cuts too rapid given the balance of risks to price stability we face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Believes that the underlying disinflation process remains intact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prospective path of bank rate from here is downward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My dissent from that decision does not reflect a fundamental difference with the committee majority.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We now need cautious cuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not new as Pill already mentioned last week that he wants to go more slowly on rate cuts now given the uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So much fuss for nothing as US yields erase the downgrade rise</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;There was so much noise over the weekend and yesterday about the Moody&apos;s downgrade with even some doomsday scenarios. I&apos;ve argued (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/us-30-year-treasury-yield-rises-to-5-for-the-first-time-since-april-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that it was no big deal and just a symbolic thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the US30Y chart now, the market erased the entire rise and we are basically back to where we were before the downgrade. We can now go back to focus on what really matters, which is future Fed policy and inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-wants-lower-interest-rates-but-hes-strategy-is-likely-to-lead-to-higher-rates-20250512/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
 there&apos;s limited downside at the moment for yields and the path of least
 resistance remains to the upside as inflation risk increases. In fact, 
as we now price in better and better conditions for growth, the economic
 activity will 
likely start to accelerate and that could lead to inflationary 
pressures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is also in a difficult position because rate cuts now
 could exacerbate inflation fears and drive long term yields even 
higher. That&apos;s what will drive the bond market in the next months. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some members said JGB market functionality improving as a trend due to BoJ&apos;s taper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other participants said there is distortion between super-long yields and yields for other maturities due to dwindling liquidity in super-long JGB market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some market participants called for faster pace of BoJ taper from fiscal 2026 though others called for maintaining or slowing pace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions from market players included those wanting new taper plan to cover about two years, and others saying BoJ should lay out a 1-year plan then maintain that taper level thereafter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions by market players on monthly BoJ bond buying amount at the end of new taper period ranged from zero, 1-2 trillion yen, and about 3 trillion yen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opinions by market players included one calling for nimble response to sharp decline in liquidity for super-long JGBs such as termination of taper or increase in BoJ&apos;s purchase amount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others said worsening supply-demand for super-long JGBs is due to structural factor such as lack of investor demand, and not something BoJ can fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s long end yields continue to increase pretty fast, with the 30yr hitting the highest on record after the auction of 20-year bonds got the lowest demand since 2012. Here market participants lay out a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinflation is on track, but new shocks are posing new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs may be disinflationary in the short run but pose upside risks over the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appreciation of the Euro is historical opportunity to foster the international role of the Euro.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s nothing new here but I agree that tariffs are disinflationary in the short term given the negative demand shock but it could indeed pose upside risk on inflation going forward especially if you get the reversal in policies like we&apos;ve seen with Trump and therefore potential pick up in economic activity as uncertainty eases.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;In the European session, the main event was the RBA policy decision. The central bank cut interest rates by 25 bps as expected but delivered some dovish messages. The RBA emphasised growth risk caused by trade policies and revised growth and inflation forecasts lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AUD got pushed lower after the release but started to recover most of the losses before RBA&apos;s Govenor Bullock mentioned that they did discuss a 50 bps cut. That pushed the Aussie dollar to new lows before another bounce as the following comments struck a more neutral tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American session, we have the Canadian CPI report where the Trimmed Mean Y/Y is expected at 2.9% vs. 2.8% prior and the Median Y/Y is seen at 2.9% vs. 2.9% prior. The market is pricing a 62% chance of a 25 bps cut at the upcoming meeting and a total of 47 bps of easing by year-end. A higher than expected reading could see the market put aside a rate cut at the upcoming meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also have some more Fedspeak and the focus will be on potential hawkish comments as the market is now back at pricing just two rate cuts in 2025. From now on, we will either price in more cuts or less cuts than expected and that will move markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;08:00 GMT/04:00 ET - BoE&apos;s Pill (hawk - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:00 GMT/06:00 ET - ECB&apos;s Cipollone (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:00 GMT/06:00 ET - ECB&apos;s Knot (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:00 GMT/09:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Bostic (hawk - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:00 GMT/09:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Barkin (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13:30 GMT/09:30 ET - Fed&apos;s Collins (neutral - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17:00 GMT/13:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Musalem (hawk - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21:00 GMT/17:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Kugler (dove - voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23:00 GMT/19:00 ET - Fed&apos;s Daly (neutral - non voter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

 producer prices in April 2025. By contrast, non-durable and durable 
consumer goods, capital goods and intermediate goods were more expensive
 than in the same month of the previous year. When energy prices are 
excluded, producer prices in April 2025 were up 1.5% on April 2024 and 
increased by 0.4% compared with March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The AUD is lower across the board following the RBA decision. The statement was basically the same of what we&apos;ve got in April although there&apos;s more emphasis on trade policies risk. What weighed on the Aussie dollar was the negative revision in growth and inflation forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP growth seen at 2.0% in June 2025, 2.3% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027 (May forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.7% in June 2025, 2.7% in June 2026 and 2.7% in June 2027 (February forecasts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is no big deal because forecasts can change and the central banks have no conviction on what&apos;s next for policy and so on. My expectation is that we will have a rebound in growth and that would place upward pressure on inflation considering the recent rate cuts and fiscal boosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would expect the central banks, including the RBA to deliver less rate cuts than currently priced in. So I would fade this reaction in the AUD, especially versus other currencies because I&apos;m still a bit bullish on the USD until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a nice support zone around the 0.6350 level on AUDUSD. Of course the pair is 80% driven by the USD, so the US macro factors are more influential, but if the sellers manage to extend the pullback, the support zone could be a nice spot where the buyers can look for dip buying opportunities. A break lower though, should open the door for the 0.60 handle next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data on inflation for the March quarter
						provided further evidence that inflation continues to ease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staff forecasts released today project that
						while headline inflation is likely to rise over the coming year to around the top of the band as
						temporary factors unwind, underlying inflation is now expected to be around the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range throughout much of the forecast period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While recent announcements on tariffs have resulted in a rebound in
						financial market prices, there is still considerable uncertainty about the final scope of the tariffs and
						policy responses in other countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These
						developments are expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World trade policy is
						changing rapidly, thereby making the central forecasts subject to considerable uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private domestic demand appears to have been recovering, real
						household incomes have picked up and there has been an easing in some measures of financial stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A range of indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain tight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
						domestic and international developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board judged that the risks to inflation have become more balanced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation is in the target band
						and upside risks appear to have diminished as international developments are expected to weigh on the
						economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With inflation expected to remain around target, the Board therefore judged that an easing in
						monetary policy at this meeting was appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board assesses that this move will make monetary
						policy somewhat less restrictive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board considered a severe
						downside scenario and noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international
						developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
						doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
						in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, this is what I anticipated in the &quot;heads up&quot; article. The RBA lowered the cash rate as an acknowledgement of inflation progress but remains cautious on the future outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank emphasised the risks around trade policies though and the potential drag on growth. That&apos;s why it has cut growth and inflation forecasts, which is what is weighing on the AUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBA forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Mean Inflation seen at 2.6% in June 2025, 2.6% in June 2026 and 2.6% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GDP Growth seen at 1.8% in June 2025, 2.2% in June 2026 and 2.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unemployment seen at 4.2% in June 2025, 4.3% in June 2026 and 4.3% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cash rate assumed at 4.0% in June 2025, 3.2% in June 2026 and 3.2% in June 2027&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2025/mr-25-13.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its cash rate target by 25 bps bringing it to 3.85% vs 4.10% prior. Focus will be on macro forecasts and forward guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the RBA will keep its neutral stance as it lowers the cash rate just as acknowledgement of inflation progress and as an &quot;insurance&quot; for some potential slowdown given the recent economic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
