                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;172&quot; data-end=&quot;758&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Major U.S. equity indices ended the day in positive territory after a choppy session marked by sharp swings in tech stocks and shifting investor sentiment around trade and Fed policy. Early pressure came from weakness in Alphabet and Apple shares, following comments from Apple’s VP of Services indicating that search and browser usage declined in April—the first drop on record. In response, Apple is reportedly exploring the integration of AI-powered search in its browsers, a move that could threaten Alphabet’s search revenue, given its long-standing default search deal with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;760&quot; data-end=&quot;1210&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets briefly turned higher after the Fed policy decision, only to retreat following Fed Chair Powell’s press conference, where he emphasized elevated uncertainty and a data-dependent stance. However, a late-session boost came after reports that President Trump may rescind global chip export restrictions amid ongoing debate around AI-related controls. That headline sent semiconductor stocks sharply higher, lifting the broader indices with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1212&quot; data-end=&quot;1286&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the close, all major indices posted gains for the first time this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1287&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1289&quot; data-end=&quot;1361&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average: +284.97 points (+0.70%) to 41,113.97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1362&quot; data-end=&quot;1413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1364&quot; data-end=&quot;1413&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500: +24.37 points (+0.43%) to 5,631.28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1414&quot; data-end=&quot;1475&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1416&quot; data-end=&quot;1475&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;NASDAQ Composite: +48.50 points (+0.27%) to 17,738.16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1476&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1478&quot; data-end=&quot;1531&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Russell 2000: +6.47 points (+0.33%) to 1,989.66&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple closed down $-2.26 or -1.14% at $196.25. The low price extended to $193.25 before rebounding into the close &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Alphabet fell $-11.85 or -7.26% at $151.38. The low price extended to $147.84&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The minutes from the Bank of Japan due today are for the March meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the meeting minutes the Bank publishes its &apos;Summary of Opinions&apos;. For this meeting these can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/boj-summary-of-opinions-march-meeting-20250327/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan Summary of Opinions of the March 18 and 19 meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting in March the Bank remained on hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key points from the Summary were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BOJ will continue to hike rates if economy, prices move in line with forecast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The downside risks from the U.S. are heightening sharply and could have negative impacts on Japan’s economy, so we must be even more cautious on deciding next rate-hike timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downside risks to Japan’s economy are, in turn,  heightening due to U.S. tariff policy, supply chain disruptions, so must keep policy steady for time being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those final two are why the Bank is on hold and looks like could be for another few meetings. The meeting that followed on May 1 also saw the Bank leave policy on hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>USDJPY sellers tried, the buyers are now making a run.</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The seller of the USDJPY tried, but the 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart found support buyers. The low reached 142.89.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inability to move lower, gave the buyers the go-ahead to push higher, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price moved up toward the 100-bar MA at 143.953 on the 4-hour chart after moving through the 200 hour MA at 143.51. The high reached 143.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those bookends helps to tell a story of the Fed too. The Fed Chair does not know what to expect except perhaps he is tilted to the downside. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Some headlines are crossing about the Trump administration rescinding chip curbs and both the Nasdaq and Nvidia have jumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump will not enforce the AI diffusion rule set to take effect May 15&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a Biden-era rule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It comes ahead of a Middle East trip where Saudi Arabia and the UAE have bristled at restrictions on acquiring chips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump officials are working on a new rule that would strengthen control of chips abroad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even with removing this, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries have faced chip exports controls since 2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could be part of a bigger deal as the UAE has pledged to invest as much as $1.4 trillion in US technology and infrastructure over the next decade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-amid-ai-restrictions-debate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Full report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market got very excited about this but it&apos;s more about chip shipments to the Middle East/India and it presumably doesn&apos;t effect tariffs or restrictions on shipping chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the market initially read this as Trump taking tariffs off chips but that&apos;s not what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US dollar rallies through the FOMC decision and press conference</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The US dollar caught a solid bid in the back half of the press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and I&apos;m not quite sure why. The moves aren&apos;t huge but in the 20-30 pip range including a 70 pip bounce in USD/JPY from an initial dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming message from the FOMC was that they don&apos;t know what they will do next, are watching data and are prepared to move quickly when they get a clearer picture. But also that they think the economy is currently strong, despite negative GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, the tone was hawkish and that should lead to US dollar bids. The chance of a Fed rate hike in June is down to 22% and July is at 85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the bond market isn&apos;t exactly validating the dollar move. US 2-year yields are flat on the day and 10s are down 4.5 bps and near the lows of the day. Stocks are flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sympathetic to the idea that the Fed will inevitably fall behind the curve because they&apos;re navigating a very unusual and fluid set of circumstances. But I was also impressed with Powell&apos;s defense of the US economy and confidence that the underlying fundamentals are good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the market will quickly shifts its focus back to the trade war and that&apos;s likely what is causing the cross currents today.&lt;/p&gt;

The 100-hour MA, 200-hour MA, and the 100-bar MA on the 4-hour chart are tightly grouped between 0.5956 and 0.5965, creating a key barometer area for traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;340&quot; data-end=&quot;474&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This cluster has acted as a pivot in recent sessions, and price action around this zone will be crucial in determining near-term bias:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;476&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;476&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;478&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hold above 0.5965 keeps buyers in the game, with eyes on the 0.5994-0.6003 resistance zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;574&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;576&quot; data-end=&quot;724&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Break below 0.5956 and stay below would shift momentum in favor of sellers. 0.5943 (low from yesterday&apos;s trade). 0.5893. Corrective low from last week&apos;s trading and lowest level going back to April 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;726&quot; data-end=&quot;789&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Momentum will likely follow the break. Watch this zone closely.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When tariff policies settle out, it&apos;s too early to say what will be the implications for the economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says &quot;I don&apos;t think we know&quot; how long it will take to understand risks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economy has been resilient and is in good shape&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don&apos;t think we need to be in a hurry, the data may move quickly or slowly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;ve had &apos;decent&apos; readings in housing services prices and non-housing services prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is still much we don&apos;t know&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The costs of waiting to see further are fairly low.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When we can make a better assessment we can move quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked if the Fed will cut at all says they don&apos;t know, there are cases they wouldn&apos;t cut at all and cases where cutting would be appropriate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty about the economy is extremely elevated and that the downside risks have increased, both higher unemployment and higher inflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s obvious that the right thing for us to do is &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 2024 rate cuts weren&apos;t preemptive. &quot;If anything, it was a little late.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Businesses and households are concerned and postponing decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If nothing alleviates those decisions, you would expect it to eventually show up in data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We think we can wait and move when it&apos;s clear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are feeling stress but unemployment hasn&apos;t gone up, initial jobless claims are not increasing in any kind of impressive way&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The change in sentiment has been &apos;outsized&apos;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of a June rate cut are down to 22%. The US dollar is at the highs of the day, I&apos;d guess that&apos;s on trade optimism rather than anything Powell has said.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surveys of households and businesses show a sharp decline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It remains to be seen how these developments will reflect consumers and investment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labor market is broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation remains somewhat elevated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Administration doing policy changes in: Trade, immigration, regulation cited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs so far have been significantly larger than anticipated but policies are evolving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If tariffs are sustained they&apos;re likely to create inflation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariff effects on inflation could be short-lived or could be more persistent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our goal is to ensure a one-time rise in prices is not persistent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If goals in conflict, we would evaluate how far we were from each goal and how long it would take to bring them back to balance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is time to wait before adjusting policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell didn&apos;t give up much here but pricing for a June cut continues to fall. The market may be getting some solace from the confident tone from Powell on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s almost showtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial FOMC statement was hawkish in my reading as it conceded nothing on a softening economy or jobs market while noting higher risks on both sides of its mandate. It also explained away the GDP report.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US stocks are heading lower after the Fed decision.  The big part of the statement was that &quot;The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow up 41 points or 0.10% have 40870&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -22.23 points or -0.40% at 5584.06&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -159.93 points or -0.90% at 17830.21.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yields have moved lower as the market reacts to the thought the Fed will keep rates unchanged for too long.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield -2.3 basis points &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 year yield -3.8 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield -5.2 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30 year yield -5.0 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDJPY is moved down and back toward its 100 bar moving out on the 4-hour chart at 142.847. The low price of just reached 142.897.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;83&quot; data-end=&quot;409&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The EURUSD has been fluctuating around its 200-hour moving average at 1.13456 in today’s trading but continues to hold above the rising 100-hour moving average at 1.13281—giving buyers a modest technical advantage. A break below the 100-hour moving average would be needed to tilt the bias more firmly to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;411&quot; data-end=&quot;643&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As long as the pair holds above that level, attention turns to the upside. Immediate resistance lies near the trendline around 1.1385, followed by the April 30 high at 1.14027 and then the high from last week at 1.14238.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A reporter asked Trump:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you open to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table?&quot;

Trump replied : &quot;No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t take this at face value. What&apos;s he going to say? Yes he is? Before the meeting in Switzerland on the weekend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t have to have studied The Art of the Deal to know that you shouldn&apos;t make an offer through the media before a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He talked about Gaza and India as well and the only other comments on the trade war were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he doesn&apos;t know on tariff exemptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will take a look at tariff exemptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These comments and the more-hawkish lines from the Fed are weighing on stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250319a.htm&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250507a.htm&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although swings in net exports have affected the
data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has
continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a
low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation
remains somewhat elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and
inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty aroundabout
the economic outlook has increased further.
The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate
and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have
risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain
the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In
considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue
reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency
mortgage‑backed securities. Beginning in
April, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings
by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion
to $5 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. The
Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning
inflation to its 2 percent objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the
Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for
the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of
monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment
of the Committee&apos;s goals. The Committee&apos;s assessments will take into account a
wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions,
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international
developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell,
Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan
M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel
Kashkari; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; and Jeffrey
R. Schmid. Voting against this action was Christopher J. Waller,
who supported no change for the federal funds target range but preferred to
continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings..
Neel Kashkari voted as an alternate member at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

The statement highlights something that Powell has been saying: That risks to both sides of the mandate have risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a short statement and doesn&apos;t offer much color so we will have to wait for Powell at 2:30 pm ET. The market reaction to the decision has been muted across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Trump has a long wish list for tax cuts in Congress this year and GOP leaders are aiming to pass the bill by July 4 but it won&apos;t be easy. The deficit is already at 7% of GDP and growth is slowing. In addition, the tax cuts will slash government revenue as interest payments continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where will the savings come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punchbowl &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndrewDesiderio/status/1920165119692038480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Significant change of tune from Senate GOP leaders who said at their closed-door retreat that House isn’t being aggressive enough on spending cuts &amp;amp; should still consider FMAP reductions to maximize Medicaid savings, per 3 attendees&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMAP is the share of Medicaid payments that the Federal government pays. This comes after Speaker Johnson said FMAP reductions were probably off the table after meeting with moderates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the signature bill of Trump&apos;s second term but Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this ultimately end with a huge deficit and promises that it will &apos;pay for itself&apos; but the bond market won&apos;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;

Structural uncertainty and expectations of economic slowdown continue to weigh on the dollar, even as rate differentials have shifted modestly in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;396&quot; data-end=&quot;411&quot;&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;413&quot; data-end=&quot;587&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;415&quot; data-end=&quot;587&quot;&gt;No policy change expected:The Fed is set to leave rates unchanged, so focus shifts entirely to the tone of the statement and Powell’s press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;589&quot; data-end=&quot;807&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;591&quot; data-end=&quot;807&quot;&gt;Economic language in focus:March’s statement described the economy and labor market as “solid.” With Q1 GDP contracting by 0.3%, markets will watch whether this language softens—a change would be dovish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;809&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;811&quot; data-end=&quot;1021&quot;&gt;Jobs market likely still “solid”:The April NFP gain of 177k was better than expected, even accounting for prior downward revisions, which should help preserve the Fed’s current jobs assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1023&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1025&quot; data-end=&quot;1239&quot;&gt;Market ignoring rate spreads:Despite a 10bp move in the 2-year EU-US spread in favor of the USD since April, EUR/USD is up nearly 5%, suggesting rate differentials are not driving FX right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1241&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1243&quot; data-end=&quot;1464&quot;&gt;Sentiment and uncertainty dominate:With widespread concerns about a weaker economy and persistent trade/tariff-related uncertainty, MUFG believes that a hawkish Powell is unlikely to reverse USD weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1792&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1792&quot;&gt;MUFG cautions that expecting a dollar rally from today’s FOMC may be misplaced. Even if Powell delivers a relatively hawkish message, the broader macro narrative—marked by economic uncertainty, poor sentiment, and growing expectations for Fed easing—keeps risks skewed toward further dollar weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1466&quot; data-end=&quot;1792&quot;&gt;For bank trade ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plus.efxdata.com/ad/track/4655172E54F06040571CD0AB083845AD&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1746724836325000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1-DqHQWAyrdCDGbXh_lKmY&quot;&gt;check out eFX Plus&lt;/a&gt;.

                            &lt;p&gt;Bessent is out saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Believes the debt to GDP ratio will drop next year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key word is &quot;believes&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has been focused on cutting costs and reducing the government deficits. DOGE efforts which were at first targeting $2T of cuts has been slashed to $1T and lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of May 2025, the DOGE, led by Elon Musk under the Trump administration, reports achieving approximately $160 billion in federal spending cuts. These reductions stem from various measures, including workforce downsizing, contract terminations, and program eliminations.  However, it is still unsure how much the government has saved given other costs from the cuts including severance costs and other intangible costs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pres. Trump sees tariffs as a way to add more to the Treasury as well and reduce debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;When there is a revolution, there are a lot of uncertainties. The comment that the Treasury Secretary &quot;believes&quot;, inserts an element of uncertainty from the revolutionary changes that are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;40&quot; data-end=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bessent adds ahead of the Fed decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fed should focus on both price and employment goals. Inflation and employment are in inexorably linked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tariffs for items that parents need to care for their children are under consideration.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;132&quot; data-end=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple’s SVP of Services, Eddy Cue, revealed that search and browser usage declined for the first time in April. In response, Apple is reportedly exploring the integration of AI-powered search capabilities into its browsers—a potential shift that poses a direct threat to Alphabet, which benefits from a lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Apple for default Google searches on iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alphabet shares are taking a major hit on the news, falling $-13.65 or -8.41% at $149.50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;527&quot; data-end=&quot;928&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technically, the initial selloff pushed the stock back below its 50-day moving average at $160.66, and more importantly, below the 38.2% retracement of the rally from the November 2022 low ($83.34) to the February 2025 high ($207.05) at $159.79. From its peak, Alphabet is now down 27.5%, and it has lost 20.71% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;930&quot; data-end=&quot;1053&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the stock remains above the 2025 low of $140.53 (set on April 7), the next technical support levels to watch are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1054&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1056&quot; data-end=&quot;1099&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$147.22 – swing low from September 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1100&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1102&quot; data-end=&quot;1162&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;$145.20 – 50% retracement of the Nov 2022–Feb 2025 rally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is room to roam to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sharp move underscores growing investor concern as AI alternatives like ChatGPT continue to disrupt traditional search behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1164&quot; data-end=&quot;1296&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a day of reckoning for Alphabet. They need to evolve. They will not go away but the cash cow is hurting and the data seems to be supporting it.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, AUDUSD briefly pushed above the 0.6504 swing high from early December 2024, but the breakout failed to gain traction, and the pair has since reversed lower (see 4-hour chart above). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;157&quot; data-end=&quot;439&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inability to hold above that key resistance level suggests buyers lacked the momentum to drive the next leg higher and has helped lead to more selling today from a technical perspective.  .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;441&quot; data-end=&quot;698&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, the pair is trading lower and retesting the 200-day moving average 9higher green line on the chart below), currently at 0.6460. A break below that level and the 100-hour MA at 0.6452, would open the door for a look toward the 200-hour MA at 0.6428 coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;700&quot; data-end=&quot;956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is also a swing area between 0.6429 and 0.6442 will be key for determining short-term direction. Holding this zone could offer buyers a base for another attempt higher. A break below, however, would shift the bias more clearly in favor of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;963&quot; data-end=&quot;987&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Key levels to watch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;988&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;990&quot; data-end=&quot;1035&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.6504 (failed breakout zone), 0.6514 (new high for 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1036&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1038&quot; data-end=&quot;1142&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support: 0.6460 (200-day MA), 0.6452 (100-hour MA), 0.6428 (200-hour MA), 0.6429–0.6442 (swing area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Apple VP of services Eddie Cue is saying that Apple is exploring adding AI to search browsers. The comments seem to have turned the stock market. The NASDAQ is now down around -59 points or -0.33% at 17631. The S&amp;amp;P is also dipping into negative territory..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google have been impacted by the announcement. It&apos;s shares are down -$7.61 or -4.5% to $156.00. Microsoft shares are down -1 dollar or -0.25% to $432.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple pays Google a fee every time a user clicks on Google. Hence the decline in Google shares. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The WSJ is reporting that tariffs could lift laptop and phone prices by some 30% according to some forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know.... Rising prices by 30% is still a threat to cost-push inflationinfluences.  The line that inflation from tariffs will only be a one time price increase may not be that.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Sector Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s stock market heatmap reveals a vibrant rally, particularly in the consumer cyclical sector, with Amazon (AMZN) leading the way with an impressive gain of 3.11%. The sector showcases robust investor sentiment, driven by optimistic forecasts and strong consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the technology sector shows moderate yet consistent gains, with Microsoft (MSFT) up by 0.46%, highlighting steady confidence in tech-driven growth. On the flip side, the energy sector faces challenges, as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) both post a decline of 0.53%, reflecting ongoing volatility in oil and gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Mood and Trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market mood is cautiously optimistic, with significant gains in consumer and tech stocks mitigating losses in more volatile sectors like energy and industrials. Investors appear to be capitalizing on consumer cyclical opportunities, while tech&apos;s consistent performance suggests long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, healthcare shows modest growth with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) up 0.30%, indicating sustained interest in defensive plays amid market fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the current market dynamics, investors might consider reinforcing their portfolios with strong consumer cyclical and tech stocks to leverage the ongoing rally. AMZN and TSLA, showing gains of 3.11% and 0.43% respectively, could be beneficial additions for those eyeing potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, caution is advised regarding energy stocks, as ongoing global concerns may continue to exert downward pressure. Investors should stay informed with evolving market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, today&apos;s market landscape offers diverse opportunities, bolstered by consumer confidence and tech stability. Staying abreast of real-time market data on ForexLive.com will equip investors to navigate these dynamic conditions effectively. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
