In a follow-up post, he proposed a flat 50% tariff on the European Union, set to begin June 1. Later in the day, he reaffirmed his position, stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for a deal with the EU. It‚Äôs set at 50%.‚Äù The message is clear‚ÄîTrump remains steadfast on tariffs, whether targeting foreign nations or U.S.-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;915&quot; data-end=&quot;1186&quot;&gt;If the EU retaliates, additional escalation could be on the horizon. This mirrors the pattern seen with China, where tariffs peaked at 145% before being temporarily reduced to 30% as of May 12, under a 90-day negotiation window. That clock is now ticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1188&quot; data-end=&quot;1335&quot;&gt;Markets opened lower on the news. Although equities recovered somewhat intraday, they faded back toward the middle of the day‚Äôs range by the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1342&quot; data-end=&quot;1383&quot;&gt;üìâ Closing Numbers ‚Äì May 23, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1384&quot; data-end=&quot;1545&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1384&quot; data-end=&quot;1436&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1386&quot; data-end=&quot;1436&quot;&gt;Dow Jones: -256.02 pts (-0.61%) at 41,603.07&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1437&quot; data-end=&quot;1485&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1439&quot; data-end=&quot;1485&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500: -39.29 pts (-0.67%) at 5,802.82&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1486&quot; data-end=&quot;1545&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1488&quot; data-end=&quot;1545&quot;&gt;Nasdaq Composite: -188.53 pts (-1.00%) at 18,737.21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1547&quot; data-end=&quot;1576&quot;&gt;üìâ Weekly Performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1577&quot; data-end=&quot;1641&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1577&quot; data-end=&quot;1596&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1579&quot; data-end=&quot;1596&quot;&gt;Dow: -2.47%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1597&quot; data-end=&quot;1620&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1599&quot; data-end=&quot;1620&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500: -2.61%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1621&quot; data-end=&quot;1641&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1623&quot; data-end=&quot;1641&quot;&gt;Nasdaq: -2.47%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;US yield started the day lower and although ending the day lower, the US session saw some debt selling (yields moved higher). The final values near the end of week sees:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 year yield 3.993%, -0.6 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-year yield 4.077%, -2.5 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year yield 4.509%, -4.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30-year yield 5.031%, -3.3 basis points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading week, the yield curve is steep and with a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-year yield unchanged&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 year yield is up 6.4 basis points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30 year yield rose sharply by 12.7 basis points (on it&apos;s way back above 5.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That policymakers speaking today gave a cautionary tone:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicago Fed Pres. Austan Goolsbee, speaking on CNBC, emphasized that businesses are seeking consistency in policy amidst the uncertainty created by rapidly changing tariffs‚Äîparticularly pointing to the proposed 50% EU tariff as a disruptive and alarming development for supply chains. He noted growing anxiety among firms about inflationary pressures stemming from ongoing tariff announcements and warned that such moves could have stagflationary consequences‚Äîthe worst-case scenario for a central bank. Goolsbee stressed the importance of waiting for clearer data before acting, acknowledging that the effects of current policies may already be in motion but not yet visible in economic reports. While he still believes the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong, he indicated that his previous forecast for rate cuts by year-end may now be delayed by up to 16 months due to heightened uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Louis Fed Pres.Musalem warned that the Fed is closely monitoring signs that short-term inflation expectations could seep into long-term outlooks, a dynamic they are keen to avoid. He noted that businesses are already expecting higher input and output prices and are struggling to manage growing uncertainty. While GDP is currently close to its potential, inflation remains above target. Musalem also emphasized that the current environment is markedly different from the pandemic era, adding that the probability of a near-term Fed rate cut is low‚Äîestimated at just one in five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, Kansas City Federal Reserve Pres. Jeffrey Schmid emphasized that current uncertainty is largely being driven by ongoing tariff discussions. He stated that the Fed will place greater weight on hard data rather than forecasts when making interest rate decisions, cautioning against overreliance on soft data. Schmid also highlighted the need for the Fed to carefully consider its future use of the balance sheet. He acknowledged that markets have already priced in 83 basis points of rate cuts over the coming year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed - like businesses - are struggling with the uncertainty from the Trump administration and their policy actions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar would lower versus all the major currency pairs with the biggest mover being against the NZD /1.44%) and the AUDUSD (-1.31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback also fell close to 1% versus the JPY (-1.0%), CHF (-0.93%), and the CAD (-0.93%).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading week, the dollar was weaker vs all the major currencies as well::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EUR: -1.81%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JPY, -2.13%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GBP, -1.99%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHF -1.93%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAD -1.69%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AUD, -1.47%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NZD, -1.82%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at other markets: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil fell modestly this week by -0.29%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gold rose by 4.82% with its largest weekly gain since April 7 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin rose from $106,520 to $108,234&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t sound like the US and EU make a quick deal on trade that will drop the 50% tariffs that Trump recommended today and to go into effect on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The US is fully engaged and committed to securing a deal that works for both &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU commission remains ready to work in good faith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough to tell which way this is going to go but at least Sefcovic didn&apos;t go full-China style and announce immediate retaliatory tariffs -- though there&apos;s an argument that&apos;s the optimal strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p&gt;US President Trump appears to have green-lighted the Nippon Steel takeover of US Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a deal that he opposed on the campaign trail and was killed by President Biden after the election. However Nippon and US Steel sued to keep the deal alive and more-recently sweetened the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rejection of the deal was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/rejecting-the-us-steel-sale-to-nippon-steel-will-mark-the-end-of-an-era-in-us-capitalism-20241230/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;a low point for American capitalism &lt;/a&gt;and went against the idea that foreign companies should invest in the United States if they wanted to avoid tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump wrote on Truth Social that was a &apos;planned partnership&apos; and that sparked some confusion but it looks like this is just spin as the $14 billion investment is exactly what Nippon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/nippon-steel-invest-14-billion-us-steel-including-4-billion-new-mill-document-2025-05-19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dangled &lt;/a&gt;to close the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares jumped 23% and are close to the deal price of $55/share. If approved the deal could close as soon as this weekend as both Nippon and US Steel have been ready to close for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud to announce that, after much consideration and negotiation, 
US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great 
City of Pittsburgh. For many years, the name, ‚ÄúUnited States Steel‚Äù was 
synonymous with Greatness, and now, it will be again. This will be a 
planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which 
will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the 
U.S. Economy. The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 
months. This is the largest Investment in the History of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. My Tariff Policies will ensure that Steel 
will once again be, forever, MADE IN AMERICA. From Pennsylvania to 
Arkansas, and from Minnesota to Indiana, AMERICAN MADE is BACK. I will 
see you all at US Steel, in Pittsburgh, on Friday, May 30th, for a BIG 
Rally. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite how this whole sad saga unfolded, it ultimately ends up in the good place for the US as Nippon will modernize a portion of the US steel industry and force it into a more-competitive place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loser in this is Cleveland-Cliffs who lobbied hard to keep out foreign competition and investment. Shares of CLF are down 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil is settling the day up $0.33 on the day at $61.53. The high today reached $61.84. The low was at $60.06.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trading week, the price is closing down marginally by about - $0.34 or -0.54%. The high for the week was at $64.14. The low was at $60.06.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline this week was the first in 3 weeks as expectations of another OPEC+ production increase and concerns and uncertainty about growth given the tariffs environment weighs on price as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price action this week was above and below the 100/200 hour MA (blue and green lines). Those MAs come in near $61.66 (converged).  The price is closing below those MAs tilting the bias more to the downside at the end of the week. However, the MAs will be the barometer for buyers and sellers next week. Trade above is more bullish. Trade below is more bearish. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;140&quot; data-end=&quot;422&quot;&gt;The AUDUSD is pushing higher today, extending above Wednesday‚Äôs high of 0.6469 and reaching a session peak of 0.6494. The pair is up 1.26% on the day, with an 87-pip trading range, well above the 22-day average of 72 pips‚Äîhighlighting strong momentum in favor of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;424&quot; data-end=&quot;718&quot;&gt;Technically, the rally began in the early Asian session as the pair found support at an upward-sloping trendline. That bounce encouraged buyers, and the bullish tone strengthened once price broke above the converged 100- and 200-hour moving averages (blue and green lines on the chart near 0.6434).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;720&quot; data-end=&quot;968&quot;&gt;A brief dip in the early U.S. session followed Trump-related headlines that sent equities lower, but importantly, the pullback stalled right at those same hourly MAs (again near 0.6434), reaffirming them as support and setting the stage for another upward leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;970&quot; data-end=&quot;1002&quot;&gt;The latest move has seen AUDUSD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1003&quot; data-end=&quot;1058&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1005&quot; data-end=&quot;1058&quot;&gt;Break above the 200-day moving average at 0.64526&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1059&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1061&quot; data-end=&quot;1127&quot;&gt;Push through a downward-sloping topside trendline near 0.64827&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1128&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1130&quot; data-end=&quot;1214&quot;&gt;Test resistance near recent swing highs (May 5 and May 14) around 0.6494‚Äì0.65005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1216&quot; data-end=&quot;1261&quot;&gt;A break above those swing highs would target:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1262&quot; data-end=&quot;1324&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1264&quot; data-end=&quot;1324&quot;&gt;2025 high at 0.65135, the highest level since December 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1325&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1327&quot; data-end=&quot;1406&quot;&gt;61.8% retracement of the 2024 high‚Äìlow move at 0.65489 (on the daily chart)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1408&quot; data-end=&quot;1624&quot;&gt;Conclusion:
Buyers remain firmly in control. Holding above the 100/200-hour MAs and 200-day MA keeps the bullish momentum intact. A break of 0.6500/0.6514 opens the door to broader upside targets toward 0.6549.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The EURUSD moved lower on the back of the post from Pres.Trump at the start of the US session that he was proposing a 50% tariff on EU imports.  Later the administration started to walk that idea back as it &quot;just a suggestion&quot; (i.e. part of the art of the deal).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the price moved down to test the rising 100-hour MA on the headlines,  and got within 5-6 pips of the MA level. Buyers leaned and the dip as risk could be defined and limited against the level  The backtracking led to more buying as London/European traders exited for the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price has now moved back toward the highs from Wednesday at 1.1362.  Above that is a 61% retracement of the move down from the April high. That little comes in a 1.1378. The high prices from May 6 and May 7 also stalled near that retracement level increasing its importance (see green numbered circles).&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;More from Treasury Secretary Bessent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;US Sovereign Wealth Fund is on pause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may be wrong but the idea stemmed from the receipts from the External Revenue Service and perhaps from the savings from DOGE.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN reality, if tariffs are too high, they won&apos;t provide any revenue as they become embargos instead.  Moreover, if the shakedown is to manufacture ALL goods in the US, that does not help tariff collections dreamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOGE fell well short of savings expected. There will be no windfall there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drill baby drill?  Baker Hughes rig counts continue to move lower as the cost is too high and oil companies are shiifting to returning capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess there may be deals with China down the road.on commodities from farmers, but those types of promises are often broken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has also touted a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. He met with the largest holders of his personal digital coin. We will probably hearing more above this type of fund as it becomes the idea du jour.  &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expect we will be negotiating with China in person again&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a Laffer Curve for tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of these non-tariff barriers are coming down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don&apos;t know where &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sees &apos;several hundred billion&apos; per year in tariff revenue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;my sense is that int he next several weeks we will have several large deals announced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeats that the EU has a collective-action problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The German finance minister was very responsive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think Merz will provide an opportunity for a US-German reset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All yields are up since the start of the year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market could also be thinking the Congressional yield could create growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says he&apos;s not concerned about USD weakening alongside higher yields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other currencies are strengthening, rather than USD weakening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much to get excited about here. If anything, the comments about a US-Germany reset are positive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USD/CAD flirts with the lowest since October</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;I have a close eye on USD/CAD today  as the pair steadily slides as part of the broader US dollar selloff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loonie is so far underperforming the AUD and NZD today in percentage terms but it&apos;s also brushing up against an important level. Moreover, the market may be hesitant to push though with US and UK holidays coming on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key item on the agenda for the loonie in the week ahead is Thursday&apos;s Canadian GDP report. RBC expects it will show the Canadian economy grew by 1.8% annualized
in Q1. The caveat is that the quarter was front-loaded with strength in January that gradually faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect to see an increase in household consumption
in Q1 that was partially offset by a contraction in residential investment as
home resales cooled. Business investment likely inched higher, but is expected
to soften in the coming quarters as businesses freeze spending plans amid
disruptive trade policies,&quot; RBC writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My major worry about Canada relates to housing, which continues to crack. Listings are mounting quickly in the Toronto area and with 5-year rates rising, there is little hope for relief any time soon. The Bank of Canada is now less-likely to cut rates in June and the rising loonie will help to cool inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The NZDUSD is stretching to new highs for the day and also new highs for the week (highest level since May 8). That move has taken the price above the 0.59664 from Wednesday, which also was near the high price going back to last week on May 14. Getting above that level is a bullish play and opens the door for further upside momentum for the NZDUSD..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increased momentum, we could see the price ultimately reach the high prices from both April and May. Those levels came between 0.6018 and 0.6028 over time (see red numbered circles on the chart below). Getting above those levels would take the pair to the highest level since November 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves to the upside, come after sellers had their shot over the last 8 or so days on breaks of the 200 bar MA on the 4-hour chart.  However, each time the price tried to extend below the 200 bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, sellers turned back to buyers fairly quickly (see green numbered circles outlining the tests of that 200 bar moving average).  That ultimately was the dominant play technically, that has moved the price higher this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video above, outlines the key levels in play and explains why.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Today‚Äôs stock market reveals a challenging environment for technology stocks, with mixed outcomes across financial and healthcare sectors.

Nvidia (NVDA), a major player in semiconductors, fell by 1.63%, continuing a challenging trend for chip manufacturers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This sector-wide decline highlights current investor hesitation amid industry-specific pressures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;üìà Financial and Healthcare Sectors: Mixed Reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The financial sector shows resilience, despite a slight pullback in Visa (V) by 1.18% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 0.66%. Interestingly, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) shows strength with a 0.99% gain, indicating potential confidence in select financial services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The healthcare sector reflects steady performance with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) up by 0.14%, signaling modest investor interest in defensive stocks during market volatility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;üöÄ Consumer &amp; Communications: Mixed Signals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon (AMZN) dropped by 0.94%, while Meta (META) fell 1.25%, contrasting with a better-than-expected performance in consumer cyclical sectors, indicating a cautious consumer sentiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) also experienced declines, hinting at investor wariness regarding future growth amid economic uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;üìö Market Mood and Strategies Forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall, the market sentiment appears cautious, driven by adverse news in technology and muted recovery signals in other sectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investors are advised to maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks associated with specific sector declines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider keeping an eye on the financial sector&apos;s potential for stability and exploring opportunities within healthcare stocks as safe havens in turbulent times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay informed and adjust your strategies as needed by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com&quot;&gt;ForexLive.com&lt;/a&gt; for comprehensive market analysis and news.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;USD/CAD is flirting with a break of the lows of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US dollar is sliding broadly today but the Canadian dollar is getting an extra lift from March and April retail sales data. The numbers were solid and come on the heels of a hotter CPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, that has the odds of a June 4 rate cut down to 28% from 65% before CPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists at CIBC were one group calling for cuts and now sound like they&apos;re just waiting for next week&apos;s GDP report to flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our forecast for a contraction in GDP in April and Q2 as a whole is driven more by expected
weakness in manufacturing and other sectors more directly impacted by US trade. Advance figures for those areas are
due to be released early next week, but if they also aren&apos;t as weak as anticipated then we will have to revise our forecast
for monthly GDP and likely our Bank of Canada rate cut call as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the report itself, they note that consumer spending has been holding up better than anticipated. The caveat is that auto sales were a big driver of stronger retail sales and that could have been a tariff front-run trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch for stops below the May low of 1.3748.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;The USDCAD remains under selling pressure after failing to sustain gains above key resistance near 1.4009‚Äì1.4026 and the 200-day MA last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;This week, the price on Wednesday fell below a swing area between 1.38917 to 1.3904.  The break and hold below this zone gave sellers the green light to drive the pair even lower and they did on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the price corrected back toward the swing area again, with the high price reaching 1.3888 just short of the low of the swing area at 1.38917.  Sellers still in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;85&quot; data-end=&quot;383&quot;&gt;Today, the momentum lower continued with the pair now looking to test the lows of 2025 (and lowest levels since October 2024).  That level comes between 1.37497 to 1.37698 (see red numbered circles).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;698&quot; data-end=&quot;829&quot;&gt;Do the buyers stall the fall at the lows for 2025?  Traders looking to buy a dip can lean with a stop below.  However, be aware that the 61.8% of the move up from the 2023 low comes in at 1.37415 - just below the low from 2025. So it might be wise for dip buyers to wait on a break of that retracement level.   &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think there is any secret on what&apos;s happening between the US and EU at the moment; Bessent spelled it out. He said the EU has been moving too slowly on trade and Trump wants to &apos;light a fire&apos; under the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was strategically timed ahead of a call today that was scheduled previously. At 12:30 pm ET, there is a call scheduled between EU trade boss Sefcovic and USA counterpart Greer will take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market will be waiting for a read-out (or leak) from that call afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: One report says this call is at 11 am ET, so watch out for headlines earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;75&quot; data-end=&quot;348&quot;&gt;The USDCHF continues to trade with a bearish tilt after a series of failed upside attempts near key technical levels. The 100-hour moving average (currently near 0.8284) served as strong resistance earlier this week, capping rallies yesterday most recently, and helping to turn buyers into sellers into the day close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;350&quot; data-end=&quot;682&quot;&gt;The recent decline seen today, initially found buyers near the 50% midpoint of the April-to-May range at 0.8257. However, EU tariff news triggered a decisive break below this level, adding downside momentum. The pair did not find support until reaching the next key swing area between 0.8193 and 0.8212‚Äîhighlighted by past price reaction zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;With price now below both the 100- and 200-hour moving averages and under key Fibonacci retracement levels, the bears remain in control unless buyers can push the pair back above 0.8257 (50%) and then 0.8284 (100 hour MA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;684&quot; data-end=&quot;886&quot;&gt;Overall, howver, the technicals are doing their job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;888&quot; data-end=&quot;913&quot;&gt;Key technical levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;914&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;916&quot; data-end=&quot;996&quot;&gt;Resistance: 0.8257 (50% retracement), 0.8284 (100-hour MA), 0.8300 (200-hour MA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;997&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;999&quot; data-end=&quot;1050&quot;&gt;Support: 0.8212/0.8193 (swing area), 0.8163, 0.8139&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;1051&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1053&quot; data-end=&quot;1129&quot;&gt;Bias: Bearish below 0.8284, with further downside potential if 0.8193 breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;If you missed it, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/trump-recommends-a-50-tariff-on-eu-starting-on-june-1-20250523/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;earlier &lt;/a&gt;&apos;recommended&apos; a 50% tariff on the EU starting June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump believes EU proposals have not been of good quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would like to have Apple help US to make semiconductor supply chain better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump trying to bring back precision manufacturing to the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Says US is &apos;far along&apos; with India and Asian countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most countries negotiating in good faith except EU&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These deals are moving quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will see more deals announced in 90-day period&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate comments are coming from the German foreign minister:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We support Commission to defend the European market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both markets would suffer, that&apos;s why we want further negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, we should have been bracing for something. Trump took a break from the trade war to go to the Middle East and wouldn&apos;t have wanted to announce something like this during the G7 on Wed/Thurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Trump will attend the G7 in Canada from June 15-17, so if he follows the pattern of lowering tensions during international visits, that leaves a three-week window.&lt;/p&gt;
