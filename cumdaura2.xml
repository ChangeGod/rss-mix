                            &lt;p&gt;Bessent will meet with China&apos;s vice premier in Switzerland to break the ice on trade talks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading these comments from Bessent you get the sense he is trying to lower our expectations. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s necessary. Anyone with half a brain knows this upcoming talk fest will achieve very, very little. Its just a beginning, that&apos;s all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;ve agreed to talk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then on Saturday and Sunday we will agree what we&apos;re going to talk about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My sense is this will be about de-escalation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&apos;ve got to de-escalate before we can move forward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier news:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/sources-say-us-bessent-and-greer-to-meet-with-china-rep-on-economic-matters-this-week-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link article-link&quot;&gt;&quot;Sources&quot; say US&apos; Bessent and Greer to meet with China rep on Economic Matters this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/australian-dollar-higher-on-talk-of-bessentgreer-china-vice-premier-he-lifeng-meeting-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link article-link&quot;&gt;Australian dollar higher on talk of Bessent/Greer/ China Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-confirms-vice-premier-he-lifeng-to-talk-trade-with-bessent-this-week-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link article-link&quot;&gt;hina confirms Vice Premier He Lifeng to talk trade with Bessent this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/china-s-ministry-of-commerce-says-is-has-decided-to-agree-to-engage-with-the-us-20250506/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;China&apos; s Ministry of Commerce says is has &quot;decided to agree to engage with the US&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;72&quot; data-end=&quot;401&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;India has confirmed carrying out missile strikes on what it described as terrorist camps across the border in Pakistan, including areas in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. According to the Indian government, the operation targeted nine sites and was executed with &quot;considerable restraint&quot; in both target selection and method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pakistani security officials reported that missiles were fired into three locations along the border. The strikes mark a significant escalation in cross-border tensions, though India has framed the operation as a limited and precise response to security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;More, as updates come in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pakistan has closed its airspace to all flights, effective immediately - for 48 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pakistan said five locations have been hit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;at least three died and 12 injured&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pakistan&apos;s response is underway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;India says all air defence units have been activated all along the India-Pakistan border&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The missile strikes carried out by India, were a response to a deadly terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier in the town of Pahalgam, located in Indian-administered Kashmir. On April 22, gunmen opened fire on a group of Hindu tourists, resulting in the deaths of 26 individuals and injuring several others. The Resistance Front, a militant group believed to be linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;403&quot; data-end=&quot;665&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;India accused Pakistan&apos;s military and intelligence services of orchestrating the massacre, an allegation that Islamabad has vehemently denied. In the aftermath, India undertook a series of retaliatory measures, including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, expelling Pakistani diplomats, halting bilateral trade, and closing the Attari-Wagah border crossing. These actions significantly escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and set the stage for the subsequent missile strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

We did get a fresh leak today about the UK but it appears to be limited to autos and steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would highlight two comments that add to the apprehension about the path of the trade war:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bessent said they weren&apos;t talking with China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trump in his meeting with Carney indicated that the US will dictate trade deals to others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To balance that, Trump talked about the importance of a friendly relationship with Canada so it all wasn&apos;t bad news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the US dollar was steadily sold and there was a massive bid in gold, both highlighting mounting worries about the trade war. Some of the dollar weakness could be position squaring ahead of the Fed tomorrow but I don&apos;t see much of a scope for a big dovish shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in the day, we&apos;re getting some Indian strikes on Pakistan and with one nuclear-armed country shooting at another, that could further add to gold and yen bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of market moves, AUD/USD is flirting with 0.6500 for the first time this year as its sharp comeback from the Liberation Day lows continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro got some bids as Merz made it though on the second vote but it was a fleeting pop, as it as widely expected. The euro did manage to string together a nice gain but it was largely in line with GBP and the overall USD move.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;ForexLive had the news of the China government notice issued Tuesday post earlier.

                            &lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P index is closing lower for the second consecutive day. That comes after nine straight days of gains. The NASDAQ and Dow industrial average also fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the closing levels shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -390.83 or -0.95% at 40829.00.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -43.52 points or -0.77% at 5606.86&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -154.58 points or -0.87% at 17689.66.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small-cap Russell 2000 fell -21.07 points or -1.05% at 1983.18.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The employment data from New Zealand is for the January - March quarter. The unemployment rate is expected to have risen. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is on a likely continued rate cut course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the data the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will publish its Financial Stabilty Report - there will be a media conference related to this, I&apos;ll post headline comments of relevance to traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noted data for New Zealand and Australia with text as the similarity of the little flags can sometimes be confusing.

      <title>USD/CAD takes the first Trump-Carney meeting in stride. Discussions were &apos;constructive&apos;</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;Carney didn&apos;t get &quot;Zelensky&apos;d&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bar for today&apos;s meeting between the North American leaders was to avoid a meltdown and as the picture above shows, it went well enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian PM is out with a readout now and said discussions were &apos;constructive&apos; and &apos;wide ranging&apos; and agreed to discuss more and have a meeting at the G7. Those are mostly coded words and not exactly great ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a CAD bull, you would have hoped for some positive talk about a reset and a North American bloc but that wasn&apos;t really the case. If you are a CAD bear, you would have hoped for a damaging breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of those things happened so it looks like the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we established a good basis today,&quot; Carney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bigger picture today, the US dollar is selling off broadly and that has USD/CAD down 56 pips to 1.3769. The broader market is starting to worry about the lack of progress on trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fear that a nine-day stock market rally has emboldened Trump to push harder on tariffs and that&apos;s going to make trade deals with allies a very tough proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More from Carney:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were no decisions on tariffs today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a very complex situation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was clear with Trump that Canada will never be for sale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We made progress, had very comprehensive, tangible exchanges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There will be meetings between ministers and officials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Progress would not necessarily be evident during negotiations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the point at which serious discussion begins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The AUDUSD found support today at 0.6437, holding within a key swing area between 0.6427 and 0.6442. The rebound during the early U.S. session lifted the pair back above its 200-day moving average at 0.64608. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price is now testing the psychologically important and natural resistance target at the 0.6500 level, with additional resistance at an early December 2024 swing high of 0.6504. A sustained move above this zone would distance the pair from its 200-day moving average and could trigger further upside momentum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next targets come between 0.65357 and 0.65537. The 61.8% retracement of the move down from the September 2024 high is at 0.65486 which is within that swing area.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The major US indices remain in negative territory for the second consecutive day. The S&amp;amp;P snapped its nine day win streak yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market currently shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dow industrial average -296.55 points or -0.72% at 40922.98.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P index -25.78 points or -0.46% at 5624.64.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ index -92.57 points or -0.52% at 17752.38.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the S&amp;amp;P and the NASDAQ indices have been able to stay above their 50-hour moving average. The current rising 50 hour moving average for the S&amp;amp;P is at 5592.28 and for the NASDAQ index, 17607.38. Staying above those levels keeps the buyers and firm control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings after the close include supermicro computer. Recall from last week they lowered their estimates for EPS and revenue. AMD and Ruby and will also report after the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning, Uber, Walt Disney, Unity Software will be announcing before the open:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;267&quot; data-end=&quot;287&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wednesday (May 8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;267&quot; data-end=&quot;287&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the Close:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;288&quot; data-end=&quot;436&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;288&quot; data-end=&quot;298&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;290&quot; data-end=&quot;298&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Applovin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;299&quot; data-end=&quot;308&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;301&quot; data-end=&quot;308&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Carvana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;309&quot; data-end=&quot;323&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;311&quot; data-end=&quot;323&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Arm Holdings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;324&quot; data-end=&quot;342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;326&quot; data-end=&quot;342&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cleveland-Cliffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;350&quot; data-end=&quot;360&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;352&quot; data-end=&quot;360&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;DoorDash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;361&quot; data-end=&quot;373&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;363&quot; data-end=&quot;373&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dutch Bros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;443&quot; data-end=&quot;467&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thursday (May 9)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;468&quot; data-end=&quot;488&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before the Open:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;630&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;489&quot; data-end=&quot;498&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;491&quot; data-end=&quot;498&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Peloton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;499&quot; data-end=&quot;508&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;501&quot; data-end=&quot;508&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;509&quot; data-end=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;511&quot; data-end=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;ConocoPhillips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;526&quot; data-end=&quot;534&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;528&quot; data-end=&quot;534&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Warner Bros.

                            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures are settling at $59.09. That&apos;s up $1.96 or 3.43%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;75&quot; data-end=&quot;327&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the hourly chart, today’s rally stalled at $59.79—just shy of the falling 200-hour moving average at $60.01 and the 50% retracement of the April 23 to May 4 decline at $60.08. A break above both those levels is needed to strengthen the bullish bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;329&quot; data-end=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the downside, the price is hovering near the broken 38.2% retracement at $58.96. A move back below that level would open the door for further downside probing, with the 100-hour moving average at $58.06 as the next target for sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The FT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/ca3837bb-34e3-4e15-b4e6-f4c927a3af5a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that the US and UK are close to a trade agreement that would lower UK quotas on cars and steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The agreement would include lower-tariff quotas for UK steel and car exports to the US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The UK is hoping to secure reductions in the sector specific 25% tariffs that Trump has levied on steel and autos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK&apos;s concessions include changes to digital services tax, cuts on US auto export tariffs, and reduced tariffs on US agricultural products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK refuses to accept US food production standards like chlorine-washed chicken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK industries, especially luxury car brands like Bentley and Jaguar Land Rover, are facing &quot;severe&quot; impacts from the current tariffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report is short on the critical question: What tariffs will the US continue to charge the UK? The UK overall is facing a 10% rate but also 25% of autos and steel. This appears to deal with only the latter two but it&apos;s short on details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked last week like a deal with India was coming but now it looks like the UK could be first out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the market reaction here has been very muted, even in GBP/USD.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The gold buyers are back in a big way following the holiday in China and other parts of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold surged yesterday and traced out an outside bullish reversal. That pattern extended today in a powerful signal for gold buyers. If we close here it will be the second-best closing level ever and just $10 from the closing record on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big level though is $3500, which is where gold stalled on April 22. That was followed by a heavy round of profit taking that coincided with optimism about US trade deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately though, progress appears to have stalled. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today confirmed that the US and China aren&apos;t talking. He continued to tease other trade deals but the market is at the point where it wants to see less talk and more signed papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump today said he&apos;s tired of questions about when deals would be struck and &quot;we&apos;re going to put down the price the people are going to have to pay to shop in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going to put very fair numbers down, and we&apos;re going to say, here&apos;s – what this country, what we want. And congratulations, we have a deal. And they&apos;ll either say &apos;great,&apos; and they&apos;ll start shopping, or they&apos;ll say, not good,&apos;&quot; Trump said alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;&quot;It&apos;s going to be a very fair number, it&apos;ll be a low number. We&apos;re not looking to hurt countries,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;whitespace-pre-wrap break-words&quot;&gt;This all sounds like improvisation and Trump has likely been emboldened by the bounce back in stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;
