      <title>PBOC cuts Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) by 10bp for both 1- and 5-year loans</title>

                            &lt;p&gt;The cuts were expected.  The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said that 10 basis point cut would lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivered today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPRs are no longer as important as they once were. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC) shifted its primary monetary policy tool to the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) rate. This transition began in mid-2024. This move aligns China&apos;s monetary policy framework more closely with global standards, such as those of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which typically rely on a single short-term policy rate to guide market expectations and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;Chinese state banks are cutting deposit rates today as previewed earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-chinas-state-banks-are-expected-to-cut-deposit-rates-today-tuesday-china-time-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;ICYMI - China&apos;s state banks are expected to cut deposit rates today (Tuesday China time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we&apos;ve had cuts announced from China Merchants Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More now, from Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Postal Savings Bank of China. All cutting yuan deposit rates. Chinese banks are under pressure to support economic growth amid a property crisis, weak loan demand and record low interest margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts are on time deposits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; by 5 bps to 0.05%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cuts on one-year time deposits by 15 bps to 0.95%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 bp cuts on three- and five- year time deposits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts are part of stimulus efforts from China. The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said a 10 basis point cut will lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.The monthly LPR fixing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/economic-calendar-in-asia-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cut-expected-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;article-link&quot;&gt;due at 0100 GMT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPR cuts should help banks lower their funding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;People&apos;s Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), China&apos;s central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a &quot;band,&quot; around a central reference rate, or &quot;midpoint.&quot; It&apos;s currently at +/- 2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the process works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day&apos;s trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervention: If the yuan&apos;s value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency&apos;s value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese state banks are cutting deposit rates today as previewed earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/news/icymi-chinas-state-banks-are-expected-to-cut-deposit-rates-today-tuesday-china-time-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ICYMI - China&apos;s state banks are expected to cut deposit rates today (Tuesday China time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we&apos;ve had cuts announced from China Merchants Bank,
China Construction Bank,ICBC, Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today are Loan Prime Rate (LPR) settings. A cut to these is also expected. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;A 25bp cash rate cut is almost unanimously expected. The latest set of forecasts I have seen have all analysts look for 25bp but two, who are looking for a 50bp rate cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m on the 25bp, 50 seems a little extreme for a usually very timid RBA. Earlier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/75bp-of-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cuts-to-come-reuters-poll-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; data-article-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;75bp of Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts to come (Reuters poll)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;175&quot; data-end=&quot;436&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In its note, TD Securities expects the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to deliver a widely anticipated 25 basis point rate cut at today’s policy meeting, bringing the cash rate to 3.85%. The forecast aligns with market consensus and fully priced expectations in OIS markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;438&quot; data-end=&quot;613&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The bank notes that recent inflation and labour market data have broadly matched the RBA’s February projections, providing sufficient grounds to shift toward an easing stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;615&quot; data-end=&quot;854&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While attention will centre on the rate decision, TD says the RBA’s commentary on global tariff risks will be key. “We see risks of minor downgrades to GDP forecasts,” analysts wrote, “but doubt that CPI projections will shift materially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Markets will be closely watching the RBA&apos;s forward guidance for signals on whether this marks the start of a broader easing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bolding above is mine. I don&apos;t expect too much in the way of promises of future cuts, but the RBA will leave the door open, data dependent etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;856&quot; data-end=&quot;986&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Bullock&apos;s news conference will follow an hour after the Statement. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;177&quot; data-end=&quot;356&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;UBS is advising investors to maintain a full strategic allocation to U.S. equities, even after the recent market rally and Friday’s U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody’s to Aa1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;358&quot; data-end=&quot;541&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a note published Monday, the bank clarified that its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/stock-market-update/ubs-downgrades-us-equities-to-neutral-but-12-month-view-is-for-higher-20250513/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;recent downgrade of U.S. equities&lt;/a&gt; from “Attractive” to “Neutral” reflects short-term valuation concerns, not a bearish outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;543&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We continue to recommend a full strategic allocation,” UBS wrote. “Earnings season highlighted the resilience of structural AI trends, and we expect U.S. stocks to move higher over the next 12 months.” The bank remains overweight on communications services, information technology, health care, and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;543&quot; data-end=&quot;853&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I would have thought neutral would mean less than a full allocation. Maintaining &quot;full strategic allocation&quot; despite trimming its outlook seems convoluted reasoning to me. But, hey, maybe that&apos;s why they get paid the big $$$?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
                            
                            &lt;p data-start=&quot;64&quot; data-end=&quot;454&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that growing U.S. financial volatility could spark a sudden scramble for dollars, particularly from non-bank investors holding vast off-balance-sheet FX swap positions. BIS official Hyun-Song Shin said more than $80 trillion in FX swaps—essentially short-term dollar debt—are held by funds and institutions outside the banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;456&quot; data-end=&quot;749&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These swaps involve borrowing dollars while holding euros or yen, and a rapid unwinding of these positions could trigger a sharp surge in demand for the U.S. currency. “If you have to roll over that swap you have to join the scramble,” Shin said in a lecture at the London School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;751&quot; data-end=&quot;1097&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The warning follows a turbulent April marked by Trump’s tariff escalation and Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit.

Earlier in the day, the 30-year yield spiked above the key 5% level, touching 5.007% at the open. However, a wave of buying brought it down to 4.904% by the close. Similarly, the 10-year yield fell from 4.536% to 4.493%, reflecting a flight to the US bonds as traders reevaluated the impact of the downgrade and realized that the US still remains a safe haven for money flows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1111&quot; data-end=&quot;1403&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Equities also rebounded sharply. After falling as much as -273 points, the NASDAQ reversed course and closed marginally higher by 0.02%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 erased an intraday drop of -62.69 points to finish up 5.22 points, or +0.09%, marking its sixth consecutive daily gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1405&quot; data-end=&quot;1914&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The day’s news flow was driven by geopolitical developments and Federal Reserve commentary. On the geopolitical front, concerns intensified over the Israel-Gaza conflict, as Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich stated the country aims to push Gaza’s population southward and potentially out of the territory, according to Sky News Arabia. Prime Minister Netanyahu also vowed to take full control of Gaza. Israeli forces expanded their ground operations and airstrikes, reportedly killing over 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;1916&quot; data-end=&quot;2052&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A high-profile phone call between former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin also captured market attention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;2054&quot; data-end=&quot;3145&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2054&quot; data-end=&quot;2517&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2056&quot; data-end=&quot;2517&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From Trump’s perspective, the call was “very well” received. Trump said Russia and Ukraine would immediately begin ceasefire negotiations and highlighted Russia’s interest in expanding trade with the U.S. once the war ends. He noted that Germany, France, Italy, Finland, and the Vatican were informed of the talks, with the Vatican offering to host. Trump emphasized a diplomatic tone and the potential for mutual economic benefit post-conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;2519&quot; data-end=&quot;3145&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;2521&quot; data-end=&quot;3145&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From the Kremlin’s perspective, the call focused on normalizing U.S.-Russia relations, including discussions of a potential prisoner swap involving nine detainees from each country. Trump reportedly spoke emotionally about the desire to restore strong ties and identified Russia as a key future trade partner. While both leaders agreed to maintain dialogue and prepare for a personal meeting, the Kremlin clarified that no ceasefire timeframe was discussed. Moscow also noted Trump’s preference for diplomatic agreements over sanctions, and expressed support for U.S. efforts in the Middle East and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Fed today, the theme from monetary policy perspective was that of uncertainty: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic this morning on CNBC warned that Moody’s downgrade could have wide-reaching effects across the economy and financial markets, particularly by raising the cost of capital and introducing greater uncertainty. He emphasized that it may take several months to fully understand the impact on U.S. debt demand and inflation from tariffs. Bostic noted the Fed is cautious on rate cuts, leaning toward just one this year due to the complex interplay of inflation, tariffs, and economic sentiment. While markets are functioning well, inflation remains above target and expectations are moving in a troubling way, although firms aren’t planning large layoffs. He highlighted a disconnect between economic sentiment and data and pointed to potential ripple effects from even reduced tariffs on China&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New York Fed President John Williams struck a cautiously optimistic tone in his remarks to the Mortgage Bankers Association, noting that recent economic data has been “very good” and the labor market is now “pretty much in balance.” He acknowledged that inflation continues to decline slowly and monetary policy remains “in a good place,” characterizing it as slightly restrictive. While first-quarter growth was affected by unusual trade dynamics, Williams emphasized that uncertainty—particularly around trade—is a defining feature of the current economic environment. He noted that many businesses and households are in a “wait-and-see” mode. Williams said the Fed still has work to do in reducing its balance sheet, though the process so far has not disrupted market pricing. He reassured that the U.S. dollar retains its status as the world’s reserve currency and that investor demand for Treasuries remains strong. Core fixed income markets, he added, are functioning well. On the consumer side, Williams observed that while households remain generally healthy, there are early signs of increasing caution. He expects the economy to slow this year and stressed that the Fed can take its time with future policy decisions. He also warned that tariffs could add upward pressure to inflation and increase unemployment risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FOMC Governor Philip Jefferson emphasized that the potential impact of tariffs on the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment is a key concern. He noted that the risks to inflation and jobs will largely depend on policy decisions from the administration, many of which have not yet been finalized. Jefferson warned that tariffs could lead to a one-time rise in price levels and stressed the importance of preventing such increases from becoming embedded in inflation expectations. He reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining current policy to ensure inflation remains anchored. While acknowledging the labor market&apos;s resilience so far, he said it is still too early to assess how new trade policies might affect employment. Jefferson also confirmed that there are no active discussions about altering the Fed’s ample reserves framework. On the Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt, he indicated the Fed will treat it like any other piece of incoming data—evaluating its implications for inflation and the labor market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt; Bank of Estonia Governor, and member of the European Central Bank Governing Council, Madis Müller, spoke in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg (gated) carried the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can’t rule out further reductions in rates
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be cautious as there’s no clear need yet to actively support economic growth
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muller said he think interest rates are already low enough, they are not holding back economic recovery
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Said that while further cuts might be justified, its not obvious that significantly lower rates are necessary
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muller noted economic challenges include international trade and tariff confusion, says these will slow economic growth in the eurozone and may ease price pressure
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, he noted the potential for inflation pressures from fiscal policy in Europe after governments promised to rasie defense outlays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;China&apos;s major state banks expected  to cut their deposit rates today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;will cut rates on some fixed-term deposits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no indication of the scale of the rate cuts has been given&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts would be part of stimulus efforts from China. The People&apos;s Bank of China cut its 7 day reverse repo benchmark rate by 10bp to 1.4% earlier this month. Governor Pan Gongsheng said a 10 basis point cut will lead to a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) of the same size.The monthly LPR fixing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/economic-calendar-in-asia-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cut-expected-20250519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;due at 0100 GMT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPR cuts should help banks lower their funding costs. Chinese banks are under pressure to support economic growth amid a property crisis, weak loan demand and record low interest margins.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P is closing higher for the 6th gain in a row. The Dow is up for 3 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markets shook off the early-day declines due to the late Friday Moody&apos;s downgrade of the US debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Dow was down  -317 points at session lows, but is closing up 137.33 points or 0.32% at 42792.07&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The S&amp;amp;P was down -62.69 points at session lows, but is closing up 5.22 points or 0.09% at 5963.60.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NASDAQ index was down -273.68 points at session lows, but is closing up 4.36 points or 0.02% at 19215.46&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The G7 meting listed in the calendar is the meeting opg G7 finance minister and central bankers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&apos;s Bank of China will be setting their Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;74&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current LPR levels are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-start=&quot;76&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;76&quot; data-end=&quot;133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;78&quot; data-end=&quot;133&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;One-year LPR: 3.10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start=&quot;134&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;136&quot; data-end=&quot;231&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Five-year LPR: 3.60%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;233&quot; data-end=&quot;391&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These rates have remained unchanged since October 2024, when the PBOC implemented a 25 basis point reduction for both maturities. The one-year LPR primarily influences corporate and household loans, while the five-year LPR serves as a reference for mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-end=&quot;190&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;LPRs are no longer as important as they once were. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC) shifted its primary monetary policy tool to the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) rate. This transition began in mid-2024. This move aligns China&apos;s monetary policy framework more closely with global standards, such as those of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which typically rely on a single short-term policy rate to guide market expectations and liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;192&quot; data-end=&quot;350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 7-day reverse repo rate is a short-term interest rate used in the PBOC&apos;s open market operations to manage liquidity in the banking system. By adjusting this rate, the PBOC influences short-term borrowing costs, which in turn affect broader financial conditions, including the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), a key reference for lending rates in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;352&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of May 8, 2025, the PBOC reduced the 7-day reverse repo rate by 10 basis points to 1.40%, marking the first cut since September 2024. This reduction is part of a broader strategy to stimulate the economy amid challenges such as trade tensions and a slowing property market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start=&quot;352&quot; data-end=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of more focus is the Reserve Bank of Australia, widely expected to cut its cash rate by 25bp today, and further in the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/75bp-of-reserve-bank-of-australia-rate-cuts-to-come-reuters-poll-20250516/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;75bp of Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts to come (Reuters poll)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of the big 4 Australian banks ANZ, CBA and WPAC are tipping a 25bp cut, NAB a 50bp cut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This snapshot from the ForexLive economic data calendar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/EconomicCalendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Click here!&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The times in the left-most column are GMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the right-most column are the &apos;prior&apos; (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
