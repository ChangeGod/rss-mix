Entirely possible that we’ve found a local bottom. Entirely possible we haven’t. 

But it has been a crazy few months.

I’m proud of the fact that we stayed the course and stuck to our process when many bright, highly regarded individuals were running for the hills and calling for the next depression.

That’s what matters. Not if our long term holdings fall or don’t fall another few percent lower before finding the exact bottom.</title><link>https://x.com/StockMarketNerd/status/1915041760306225262#m</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:55:10 GMT</pubDate><guid>https://nitter.poast.org/StockMarketNerd/status/1915041760306225262#m</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;People taking this as a bottom call shouldn’t.&lt;br&gt;

They go up the vast majority of the time.

Every time. That is our reality.

We can volunteer to have it rigged against us &amp; complain. Or we can choose to have it rigged for us &amp; carefully take advantage.
