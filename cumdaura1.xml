Home payments have now surged by ~$570/month, or 25%, over the last 3 years.

The increase was driven by a combination of rising median home prices and rising interest rates.

The median home sales price increased 2.6% year-over-year, to $387,000, to its highest since August 2024.

Meanwhile, mortgage rates are rising back above 7% as treasury yields surge.

Investors are moving into private markets for stability.

One smart home disruptor is leading the charge, with 10+ patents, an Amazon partnership, and $10M+ in revenue. Now sold in 127 Best Buy locations.

This tech startup is following the acquisition blueprint of Ring ($1.2B) and Nest ($3.2B).

With 200% YoY growth and support from investors like Daymond John, it’s a rare chance to invest before their next big move.
